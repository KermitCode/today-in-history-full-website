'cont'=>'(Bingshen August 21), September 25, 1956, Mao Zedong on the wrong duality. <br> 1956, 25, 2009, Mao Zedong with some Latin American representative of the party&#39;s conversation, recalling some of the historical experience of the Communist Party of China. He pointed out: \"The Communists do not be afraid to make mistakes. Errors duality. The error on the one hand damage the party, harm the people; on the other hand is a good teacher, a good education to the party, and education of the people, good revolution. Failure is the mother of success. Failure if no good, why is the mother of success? Errors committed too much, we must turn. This is Marxism. &#39;Extremes meet&#39; errors pile up, the light will come. \"<br>'
