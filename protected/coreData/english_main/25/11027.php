'cont'=>'November 25, 2009 (Year of the OX October ninth day), the British developed the world&#39;s fastest supersonic car. the <br> detective dog \"car the pencil shape the shell from aircraft-grade aluminum built <br> <br> compared with conventional cars,\" detective dog \"The car will no longer use traditional wind tunnel testing and drawing simulation. <br> <br> test driver will be in the desert in the Northern Cape, South Africa the speed test <br> <br> & ldquo ; detective dog \"car is claimed to be the world&#39;s fastest the car <br> According to the British\" Times \"website reported, supersonic car designed by the British car engineer\" the detective dogs \"(Bloodhound ) about the recently started manufacturing is expected to cost 15 million pounds. Detective dog \"car is known as the world&#39;s fastest car, the maximum design speed of more than 1600 km per hour. It is understood that <br> detective dog \"car is expected to be completed in 2011 off the assembly line. By then, the test driver will be in the desert in the Northern Cape, South Africa speed test. The designers hope, \"detective dog car speed can reach 1600 kilometers per hour, much faster than the speed of sound. Ground car maximum speed of about 1,227 kilometers per hour, this record is created in 1997 by the British Royal Air Force pilot Andy - Green. 2011, \"detective dog car will continue to test drive by Green. <br> \"detective dog\" car pencil-shaped shell by aviation grade aluminum to create. The car a total of three engines, the first European Typhoon fighter jet engine, weighing about 400 kilograms; the second rocket engines; third engine is mainly used to transport fuel to the rocket engine. Three engines will be able to total produce 135,000 horsepower, equivalent to the power of the 180 F1 car. (Lssjt.cn) <br> is calculated based on the power of the car, the detective dog \"car will be able in a short span of 40 seconds to accelerate from a standstill to a speed of 1,689 kilometers per hour. The first test driver of the car as a \"detective dog\", Green will feel the pressure of 2.5 kg in the acceleration process, feel the pressure of 3 kg during deceleration. This pressure will make the Green systemic blood reflux, he may even stop breathing. Green will be accepted before the trial run, the series of flight training and simulation training. Green said, \"I will try to head down a flight demonstration flight. My biggest advantage is that we have 20 years of jet flying experience. Scientific and technological progress in the past decade, so I&#39;m confident. \"<br> Previously, Green had been driving the supersonic car propulsion,\" in the Nevada desert to create the ground the fastest driving record. Propulsion, \"is the world&#39;s only car a speed exceeding the speed of sound. It uses fighter aircraft turbine engine as a power, a top speed of more than 1200 kilometers per hour. However, compared to \"promote,\" \"detective dog car bodies lighter and smoother. <br> compared with conventional cars, \"detective dog car will no longer adopt the traditional wind tunnel testing and drawings analog. Its every detail (even detailed to the outer layer of the paint of the bodywork) by a group of powerful supercomputers array simulation. When speeds of up to 1600 kilometers per hour outside the body a little bit of excess coating will be sufficient to cause the the automotive direction of deviation from, or even posing a significant risk. early as 2006, the <br> (the l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) British Minister of Science and Innovation Fort - Dala Sen proposed the R & D program. Through this program, he hopes to inspire the next generation of engineers learning and innovation enthusiasm. In the UK, there are about 25,000 schools have courses detective dog \"car. In these schools, the teachers through the presentation of the structural details of the detective dog \"car, which more vividly explain the knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering. <br> comment: do not know how much faster than F1? <br>'
