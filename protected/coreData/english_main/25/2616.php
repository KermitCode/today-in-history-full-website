'cont'=>'(JiMao day of the second month), March 25, 1999, the first head of the transgenic cow was born. <br> genetic medicine experts have Yitao (left) and Huang Shu frame. (Lssjt.cn) In March 1999, 25, (lssjt.cn) reporter from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, transgenic animals and the pharmaceutical industry seminar was informed, Shanghai Institute of Medical Genetics since 1998 successfully bred transgenic sheep in early 1999 succeeded in cultivating China&#39;s first genetically modified in vitro cattle. <br> the first transgenic cow was born \"target =\" _blank \"> The transgenic cow is a bull named\" surging \"Upon a testing ground for new animal born on February 19 in Fengxian County, birth weight 38 kg. analysis of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which carries the human serum albumin gene. Chinese Academy of Engineering, the group leader, Professor Zeng Yitao bulls mature breeding calves, the birth of the \"daughter\" expected to secrete milk containing human serum albumin, which marks our transgenic animal research on a new level the <br> in 1998, Shanghai Institute of Medical Genetics the Huang Shu frame, Professor Zeng Yitao, etc. led the research group, the creation of integrated embryos transplanted transgenic sheep new technology route, so the success rate of transgenic sheep greatly improve on the basis of the success of transgenic sheep, May 27, 1998, the Task Force and application of the creation of new technology route carried genetically modified test-tube cow&#39;s trial in August head test cattle in three pregnancies and two in the second trimester abortion, the other end of full-term delivery of a transgenic tubes carrying human serum albumin gene integration Bulls. confirmed this result, Shanghai Medical Genetics, founded this Article new technical line of transgenic sheep also adapt to the development of transgenic animals in livestock. <br> research group, Professor Huang Shuzhen, cattle breeding cycle, the high cost of investment, transfer genes cattle more difficult, however, compared with the transgenic sheep annual milk yield of a cow can be as high as 10,000 kg, more than 20 times higher than the amount of goat milk. transgenic cattle is more suitable for the production of large precious drugs in human serum albumin is the domestic need a large quantity but also the shortage of drugs, if they can realize the milk to the production of this drug, and this situation will change greatly. the surging \"<br> <br> transgenic China&#39;s first test-tube cattle ;'
