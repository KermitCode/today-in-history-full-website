'cont'=>'August 25, 1227 (July 12), Chinese New Year, Genghis Khan&#39;s death. (May 31, 1162 - August 25 -1227 years ago 785 years) <br> Genghis Khan, the Mongol Khan (1206 - 1227 the reign) <br> not far away and not due to road go, go, be able to come. Not because matter weight and not to move, to be moved will be able to move - Genghis Khan; Only others have failed, the real success - Genghis Khan; greatest joy in life than to kill your enemies everywhere. invaded their land, plunder their wealth, and then listen to their wives and children crying sound - of Genghis Khan <br> Mongols deservedly named after the 13th century Mongolia Century, this century, prairie storm swept through the most of Eurasia, changed the political map of the region and the process of civilization. And Genghis Khan, is the initiator of this financial storm, the conqueror of the most prestigious history. <br> tyrant or Genghis? <br> named Temujin Genghis Khan, born in Mongolian of Nealon tribes Bo child only pounds the home of a chief of the clan. Mongolian Plateau has hundreds of tribes, entangled with each other in endless vendetta Jin Guoli with the contradictions between them, take the \"divide and conquer\" strategy, so that they become a vassal. But all <br> because Temujin&#39;s turned out to be completely changed. The Temujin rough childhood, 9 years old his father poisoned CIA, he was once caught in the enemy prisoners. Lucky escape after seeking refuge with his father, an alliance leader Wang Han Kerait Ministry by Wanghan received as a son. He used his conditions for the future generations of the clan chiefs, convened in Wanghan help of the family&#39;s old unit, and gradually developed into a brave and skilled team, the team seems insurmountable tribal warfare, and continue to grow and develop. Temujin is not only a talented military commander, is also a distinguished diplomatic strategist, highlighted in tribal warfare take joint majority focus on cracking down on individual policies, has conquered Sapporo A La Ti, Tatar, Kerait, Naiman Ministry, became the Ares elected overlord on the Mongolian Plateau. [Lssdjt.com <br> In 1206, convened Temujin lifetime, perhaps the most important one in the history of Mongolia Assembly established Temujin for all Mongolian tribes Castles on the appellation \"Genghis Khan . \" Since then, the Mongols stop the civil war, the military front unanimously. For [lssdjt.cn] <br> in the process of unification of Mongolian tribes, Genghis Khan gradually groped a country united the Mongol, they set method to become the country&#39;s basic system fixed down. Mongolian People divided into nearly one hundred one thousand to one thousand as the basic unit of the national administration, each one thousand-one is also the military and livestock production organization, one thousand under divided into one hundred ten also has a top and some one thousand households (one thousand one thousand people do not necessarily reflect nothing more than just a generic term, one hundred and ten thousand is also the same reason). Genghis Khan packet each one thousand to his sons, he actually practiced a military feudal system. Genghis Khan selected full Mongolia most skillful and loyal young a sweat the Army the direct command of the escort (called Keshik), is the pillar of strength profusely domination and conquests. <br> Mongols original text. Genghis Khan to encourage learning Fragment in Uighur Discovered word of the children of the nobility, and Fragment in Uighur Discovered word to spell Mongolian, and gradually formed a Mongolian. Genghis Khan to edit his previous General Assembly enacted the Act, military orders into the \"Zhasa ceremony, is Mongolia&#39;s first statute law. Even more powerful with the text and the statute of Mongolian (Mongolia phase for many neighboring countries, is still a \"savage\" ethnic). <br> Genghis Khan external campaign goal is relatively weak strength the Xixia, forcing Xixia surrender on the Golden State had long enslaved them after surgery. Personally led the army of Genghis Khan, holding the banner of revenge for the ancestors, the war was launched in 1211, the Mongol armies such as Tigers down trend unstoppable progress smoothly, the river battle to wipe out the main army, encroaching upon the gold capital of the country (now Beijing). Jinguo Huang Emperor hurriedly moved the capital to the south, large tracts of land in the north of the Yellow River will soon fall into the hands of the Mongols. <br> Then, Genghis Khan, the wild eyes toward the West. Is in the civil strife among the Liao is obviously not vigorous opponents of Mongolia, Genghis Khan&#39;s cavalry soon overcome this country. Then, the big countries of Central Asia Huacizimo become the next target, in 1219, Genghis Khan, the name of its killing Mongolian caravan and envoys apprenticeship 200 000 massive attack is in the heyday of Huacizimo 400,000 army of Genghis Khan in front of the army actually vulnerable, a few years of the empire on the ashes. Mongol army has done in this conquest, fully reflects the cruelty of a savage nation, must Wherever he went into the deserted ruins, the breaking of the city shall be looted, even the water cover fire. <br> control of Central Asia is a crucial step for Mongolia&#39;s conquest of activities. Times the EU as a base, the Mongols launched to the more distant and broader land. On in the conquer Huacizaimo same time, a Mongolian Expeditionary Force, along the Caspian Sea northward into the plains of eastern Europe, conquered the mutual strife continued Ross kings of the public. Genghis Khan&#39;s long-cherished wish is to conquer the world Choujin Guo, turn the main goals in the last years of his life on the East Asia. To destroy the gold must first be broken right arm - Western Xia. Western Xia military and civilian stubborn resistance the past two years, was finally forced to accept the fate of subjugation, but Genghis Khan conquered the Xixia the while, life has come to an end, he died in the army due to typhus. <br> Genghis Khan era is just the beginning of the Mongol Empire to conquer the world, inspired by his \"world is a vast land many rivers, you can each do enjoy to expand their territory\" speech, his descendants conquered more The vast land. In China, his grandson Kublai Khan established unprecedented unified dynasty Yuan dynasty, and the coronation of the Emperor of China; in Western Asia, another grandson Xu Liewu perish empire lasted more than 500 years of Arab Abbasid established Iraqi children Khanate; in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, another grandson Batu established the Golden Horde, rule number does not please the kings and tribal. Later claiming Genghis Khan descendant of Timur the Timurid Khanate in Central Asia, the descendants of Tamerlane, Babur established the Mughal dynasty in India. Sub-empire \"of the Mongol Empire,\" Sun Diguo \"who are in the history of the world has left a far-reaching impact. <br> Genghis Khan should be the column names in the world&#39;s most influential emperors, I am afraid that no one would deny. However, the relationship to the level of his rank, as well as some of the problems should be discussed. <br> the Mongolian social development in the early 13th century, whether inevitably produce a Genghis Khan, the only ruler like it? can not easily draw a conclusion, the Mongolian tribes in the medium and long term of years and years of civil war by a number of powerful tribes maintain a balance of power, if not break the balance of power, Genghis Khan such a genius strategist unified process may slow down for many years, Mongolia face to unity in the international situation and there will be a lot different, probably would not be so smooth commencement of the conquest activity. <br> Mongols have achieved great success in the foreign expeditions, more is due to the tribal tradition of brave and fierce and correct leadership of Genghis Khan himself? former accounting for the ingredients may be greater, because even in Genghis Khan&#39;s death, he successor in different regions conquer still invincible. But it also proves that Genghis Khan established military and political system after his death, and he initiated Mongolia spirit \"still has tremendous power. <br> Genghis Khan&#39;s status in the military history can not be ignored. He established a \"devious\" tactics, not directly to the sounding of the enemy&#39;s challenge, but by the long-range outflank circuitous, divided into two punch and raids to defeat opponents. Genghis Khan&#39;s military career late to face the problem of siege warfare, he developed a set of projection? Stone led the siege method tested. Genghis Khan&#39;s military ideological importance to the war by war, does not require a lot of logistical supply, of course, this is based on the expense of brutal plunder of conquered land. The war of the ancient nomads and farming nation, former occupy a certain advantage, but it is not absolute advantage, before the most powerful Mongolian nomads, such as the Huns, the Turks have had record defeat at the hands of the farming nation. Mongolia in the 13th century, it is clear beyond all predecessors, Genghis Khan, I barely was defeated on two generations of his descendants, and missed only a few times in a spent force records. the <br> Genghis Khan and his descendants conquered activities to promote the restructuring of the separatist territory of the world, a series of long-term stable existence but is the decadent country wiped off the map. Mongol rule in most areas are not very long after them, there are a series of new force from the rise of these areas. Not actually Mongols a positive impact on the process of human civilization, because they are culturally backward, the small number of barbarians in the conquest of the region can only accept the gradual assimilation of fate, the impact of the Genghis Khan to be inferior to the wide dissemination of Greece The civilization of Alexander the Great. Does not establish a clear and long-term new world order, which is Genghis Khan in the ranking of the top three reasons. <br> Mongol Empire greatest impact on history, their conquest to promote world culture plates closer links being in the same overall, the Silk Road re smooth cross-border travelers has increased considerably, relatively isolated geographical segment greatly increased understanding of the outside world. The same can be said, because the Mongols, and the world smaller. <br> Review: Genghis Khan biting each other&#39;s national grasslands together, their wolf unanimously Act and the establishment of a set of the most efficient system, create a set of best tactics in line with its own characteristics, which are invincible. Ability to to treat conquered enemies extinction strike the enemy long-term loss of a comeback, the Mongols of Genghis Khan era, shoulders burdened with the lightest moral burden. <br>'
