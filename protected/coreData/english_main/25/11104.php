'cont'=>'(Awake, October 14), November 25, 1814, the German physicist Meyer was born. On November 25 <br> 1814, Meyer was born, German physicist, discoverer of the law of conservation of energy. <br> energy neither a vacuum, does not suddenly disappear, it can only be converted from one form to another form, or transferred from one object to another object, in the process of transformation, or metastasis of its total unchanged. The law of conservation of energy is now generally recognized, but not strictly prove. <br> (1) the nature of different forms of energy with a different form of movement corresponding to: the movement of objects having a mechanical energy, the molecular motion within the can, the movement of the charge having the energy, the movement of the nuclei inside the Atomic Energy. the <br> (2) between the different forms of energy can be transformed into each other: \"friction and heat by overcoming the friction acting mechanical energy into internal energy; boiling water in the kettle, steam lid top lid acting onwards, indicating that the internal energy converted to mechanical energy; current through the electric wire acting energy into internal energy and so on. These examples show that between the different forms of energy can be transformed into each other, and by acting to complete the conversion process. can <br> (3) some form of reduction, there must be other forms of energy is increased, and to reduce the amount and the amount of increase must be equal. reduce the energy of an object, there must be other objects in the energy increase, and the reduction amount, and The amount of increase must be equal. <br> Review: thermodynamics and biophysics pioneer <br>'
