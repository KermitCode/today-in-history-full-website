'cont'=>'March 13 (Imo), April 25, 2002, China discovered the world&#39;s earliest placental mammal fossils. climbing ancestor <br> beast fossil <br> 2002 April 25, 2010, the Ministry of Land and Resources Shou Jiahua, Vice Ministry announced in Beijing: China&#39;s Liaoning Province Lingyuan City new-found climbing the ancestor beast fossil was recently The confirmation is the world&#39;s oldest placental mammal fossils. (History today www.lssdjt.com) the true mammals (placental) the origin and early evolution of mammals provide new fossil evidence. <br> in a press conference held by the Ministry of Land and Resources Shou Jiahua, this new discovery is completed jointly by the Chinese Academy of Geological Institute of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Natural History scientists. It is estimated that at least 130 million years earlier than the geological age of the fossil. This new mammal researchers named climbing ancestor beast, the meaning this mammal fossils in the real beast --- in the original position on the evolution of placental mammals system, and has the flexibility to climbing limb bones features. <br> According to reports, the newly discovered ancestor of a complete skeleton of the beast, save exquisite. Bone surrounding mammalian the fur fine prints and charring soft tissue traces. The ancestor of the beast body length of about 14 cm, the estimated weight between 200-250 g. Many of the most defining characteristics typical real beast animal ancestor of the beast&#39;s teeth, dental characteristics suggest that it is insectivorous animals. The ancestor of the beast&#39;s shoulder strap, limb bones and quadruped many modern adept at climbing or arboreal mammals unique traits. These features suggest that the ancestor of the beast is good at the activities of small mammals in the rugged the ground climbing and shrub trees, dwarf trees live in rivers and lakes shore. TodayinHistory.cn] <br> According to the project&#39;s chief scientist quarter strong introduction, other mammals symbiosis with the newly discovered ancestor beast there and beast, the Rehe beast and climb feeding the beast. Output ancestor of the beast the famous western Liaoning Rehe biota as well as a variety of fine feathered dinosaurs and primitive birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish and plant fossils. 1996 Sinosauropteryx is found in this region. newly discovered ancestor of the beast and its positioning in the mammalian system tree <br> Sino-US paleontologist fill the the earliest important evolution in the history of the original true beasts mammals blank, show that the real beast in the Early Cretaceous differentiation of mammals not only far earlier than previously estimated age of magnitude than previously known, limited early differentiation. It found that, for the study of placental mammals molecular evolution speed and the morphology and function of evolution comparative study provides an important basis. <br>'
