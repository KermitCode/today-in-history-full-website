'cont'=>'(Jiyou July 26), August 25, 1609, Galileo in Venice Parliament, the first show he produced refracting telescope. <br> <br> in 1609, Italian astronomer Galileo show at the Venice Parliament he produced the first refracting telescope. The 400 (Lssdjt.com) <br> years ago, the human understanding of the universe changed forever. August 25, 1609, an Italian mathematician called Galileo Galilei demonstrates his new creation telescope to Venetian merchants. Soon after, he turned to the telescope to the sky. He saw the mountains to cast a shadow on the moon, then realized that the moon as the earth in general, the world is a complex terrain. He saw the moons of Jupiter group --- and Church distinct taught around a celestial ring line. He saw Venus with the Moon as a gain or loss phenomenon, that Venus around the sun and turn, not the Earth, this priest more diametrically opposed. He saw sunspots, to prove that the sun itself is not as Greek cosmology of the identity of the church is so perfect celestial. But he also saw other things, which are often forgotten. He saw the Milky Way across the sky cloud-like bands formed by the stars. the <br> suggests that observed for the first time not only the earth is not the center of all things, and the vastness of the universe is far from understandable era. And since then the universe is constantly increasing and getting older. Astronomers latest estimate is that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old, three times at the time of the earth 10 times in the life of modern humans as a species. Universe in the end how much is still unknown. Its age and the limited speed of light means astronomers can surpass the 13.7 billion light years. However, the universe may be bigger than this. the <br> but the reality is not necessarily limited in this universe. Closely linked physics and astronomy tells us that the objects of the universe known as the vastness of the infinite, but maybe just one of countless similar structure, each of these similar structure to follow a slightly different laws, due to better describe refer to them as the multiverse. <br> Galileo contemporaries think contains the crystal ball of the universe with planets and stars, these stars represent the edge of the universe. The rupture of this statement (together with the point of view of Darwinian natural selection) to become the biggest revolution in human self-understanding. The Galileo that world in which cognitive level is very limited. Greeks also for the size of the Earth and its distance to the moon has clearly recognize familiar with Greek writings of medieval inherited these ideas. This distance is the people&#39;s imagination a long time to achieve the standards. It is easy to believe that in the past people heart how big the universe is as big. However now the face of the modern universe doctrine, it is harder for people to argue whether this is for human self-interest, not to mention the multiverse theory. <br> Four hundred years later, the heirs of the Galileo thought is no longer as dangerous revolutionaries. This week, they will be under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union meeting in Rio de Janeiro (Rio de Janeiro). However, they found worldwide change and as much as Galileo, these findings may have extraterrestrial life from planets around other stars, to the dark matter and the unknown nature of energy as an important material in real life. Modern man is perhaps easier than medieval people adapt to the idea of &#8203;&#8203;human beings in the universe suddenly change position. But this should not make people overlooked the universe conjecture surprised. <br> Comments: great invention changed human understanding of the universe. <br>'
