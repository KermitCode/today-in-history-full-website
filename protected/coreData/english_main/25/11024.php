'title'=>'Chinese scientists found that DNA directly new structure',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'On October ninth day (Gengwu years), November 25, 1990, Chinese scientists found DNA directly to the new structure. In In 1990, the Institute of Chemistry in the world for the first time directly observed braids like the new structure, the three-chain DNA expert evaluation This is another understanding human nature major discovery. <br> DNA is a biological storage, the main material basis for replication and transmission of genetic information, scientists explore life science mysteries it as one of the key targets. In 1989, American scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope, has directly observed the double helix of DNA, and confirmed the presence of the DNA double helix indirectly observed by X-ray diffraction method. chain DNA in <br> new structure, led by 36-year-old Bai Chunli researcher laboratory using scanning tunneling microscopy found. Before they get significant results, similar structures are scattered only speculate that some foreign scientists indirect results obtained with other techniques. Meaningful three-chain DNA directly discoverer, it is precisely the developer of chemical scanning tunneling microscope, namely, Bai Chunli leadership laboratory. This atomic resolution precision instruments, chemical and other units in 1987 by self-reliance in the country for the first time successfully developed. The scientists believe that this discovery, not only the scanning tunneling microscope has a great future in the study of biological substances, and found a major breakthrough in the understanding of DNA helix structure.
