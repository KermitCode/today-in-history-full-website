'cont'=>'January 25, 1983, the twelfth lunar month 22 (Saigon), the United States, Britain, the Netherlands jointly developed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite launch. <br> 1983 1 25, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) by the American Delta 3910 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base launched into a 900 km altitude sun synchronous circular orbit. <br> the satellite from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the country&#39;s scientists and engineers jointly designed and developed from. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> purpose of the flight is the observation of ground-based telescopes to see less than 4 8-120 microns band sky infrared source probe stellar HII regions and molecular clouds, as well as other galaxies far infrared to discover new the infrared celestial bodies, and draw the whole sky infrared celestial map. The satellite body cylindrical structure takeoff weight of about 1050 kg. <br> satellite infrared telescope at the top with a weight of 812 kg, 500 watts of power, the design life of 200-300 days. The main observational instrument onboard the U.S. Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed the liquid helium cooling infrared telescope, draw the entire universe infrared source. newly discovered <br> after the Ascension of the satellite: 3 dust particle ring between Mars and Jupiter orbit interplanetary space Piaoyou with the the the dust thin cloud (scientist named infrared Round Valley), five teeth new comets, gas and dust in the galactic center was like. <br> 1983 11 10, 2009, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite liquid intends refrigerant depleted, the end of the work in the 21st. <br>'
