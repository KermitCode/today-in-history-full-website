'class'=>3,
'cont'=>'August 25, 1867 (on July 26 Dingmao), the British physicist and chemist Faraday&#39;s death. <br> 1791, Faraday was born at home in the the London outskirts of a poor blacksmith. Meager income of his father, often sick, children and great, Faraday childhood even rice have enough to eat, and sometimes his one week only eat bread, of course, let alone go to school. <br> Faraday 12-year-old, on the streets selling newspapers. While selling newspapers, while literacy from the newspaper. To 13-year-old when, Faraday into a printing plant when bookbinding apprenticeship, his side stapled book, while learning. Whenever spare time, he looked for binding books. Sometimes even in the delivery by the way, he also walked to see. After several years of efforts, Faraday finally take off the hat of illiteracy. <br> gradually Faraday be able to read more and more books. He began reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and often read late at night. He was particularly fond of the electrical and mechanical aspects of the book. Faraday money to buy books, buy notebook, on the use of the printing of paper set into the notebook, extract all kinds of information, sometimes accompanied by illustrations. , a member of the Royal Society Dans <br> a chance came to printing proofread his book, accidentally discovered the Faraday&#39;s \"manuscripts\". When he knew it was a bound apprentice in mind the notes, surprise, Dans gave Faraday attendance of the Royal College of coupons. <br> Faraday extremely excited mood, came to attend the Royal Academy. Report exactly what the then well-known British chemist David. Faraday eyes wide open, and listen carefully to David lectures. After returning home, his finishing lecture notes into a book, as a self-learning chemistry textbooks. the <br> later, the Faraday own carefully stapled chemistry textbooks sent to Professor Dai Wei, accompanied by a letter, said: \"very willing to escape from the business community into the room in the scientific community, because as far as my imagination science can make people noble and amiable \". <br> after receiving the letter, David was deeply touched. He very much appreciated the talents of Faraday, decided to recruit him as assistant. Faraday is very diligent, and quickly mastered the experimental techniques, David&#39;s right-hand man. Six months later, <br>, David to go to the European continent for a scientific research trip, visit the famous scientist of the European countries, to visit the country&#39;s chemical laboratory. David decide with Faraday abroad. Thus, Faraday followed David travel in Europe for a year and a half, met with amps and other well-known scientists, a lot of knowledge, but also learned French. upon return of <br>, Faraday began independent scientific research. Soon, he discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction. In 1834, he discovered the law of electrolysis, shocked the scientific community. This law is named \"Faraday&#39;s law\". the Binding Book apprentices <br> Faraday rely on self-study hard, from even the elementary school did not read, and entered the ranks of world-class scientists. Engels had praised Faraday \"Until now, the biggest electrician. 25, 2009, <br> 1867 Faraday sitting in his study reading when I passed away, aged 76 years. Because of his great contribution to the electrochemical his surname - \"Faraday\" as a unit of electricity; using the abbreviation of his surname - \"Farah\" as a capacitor units. <br>'
