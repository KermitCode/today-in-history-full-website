'cont'=>'(Lunar New Year on April 21), May 25, 2008, the Mars probe \"Phoenix\" successfully landed on Mars Arctic. on Mars <br> the Phoenix <br> Phoenix No. (English: Phoenix) is a United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#39;s Mars exploration program in 2007. The main purpose of this program is sent a lander to Mars Arctic, probing the Martian polar environment. <br> Phoenix under the assistance of the anti heat shield, parachute and rocket boosters, slowly landed on the frozen surface of Mars, and then take advantage of the power accumulated by the solar panels, extending about 2.3 m mechanical arm to dig down and digging from the soil samples back to Phoenix, advanced instruments to analyze soil water ice. This program a total cost of four hundred twenty million U.S. dollars. <br> The purpose of this task is to find the the Mars Arctic soil characteristics of the possible existence of life, on the shallow underground water ice. Phoenix EST 2007 8 26 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, Florida successfully launched by a Delta II launch vehicle carried by the successful landing on Mars on May 25, 2008. Phoenix Following pirates II in 1976, only unused airbag cushioning technology and spacecraft successfully landed on Mars. [Com, history.] <br> May 25, 2010, U.S. Eastern time 18:46 (UTC: 23:46, May 25, 2009), Phoenix completed \"critical seven minutes & rdquo ; (also referred to as a \"terrorist\") landing procedures, successfully landed on Mars Arctic to become the first human space probe landed on Mars Arctic prior NASA assess the success rate of only 50%. Critical seven minutes takes about 7 minutes a series of landing procedures, Phoenix enter the Martian atmosphere at a speed of 21,000 kilometers (13,049 miles), flying at a speed down to about eight kilometers (five miles per hour ), and then the emergency brake, for soft landing. Reference 31 July 2008, the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (ESA) scientists announced heated soil samples on Mars: Phoenix Mars lander identified water vapor generated, thus confirming the presence of water on Mars. Probe \"Phoenix\" has landed successfully on Mars Arctic, in addition to the return of some precious photos, and also lay down a time capsule brought by the Earth, intends left to future human open emigrate to Mars. <br>'
