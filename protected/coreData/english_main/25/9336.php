'cont'=>'September 25, 1993 (¹ïÓÏ, August tenth day), \"Milky Way\" the whole incident. <br> 1993. Dammam, Saudi Arabia. China to participate in the Chinese cargo ship \"Galaxy\" cargo inspection <br> inspection team members in Saudi Arabia and the experts from the United States participated in the inspection capacity as the technical adviser of Saudi Arabia after 10 days of hard work, the completion of the \"Yin & rdquo ; contained in the inspection of all the goods, the Chinese inspection group Sha Zukang, Saudi Arabia on behalf of Abdullah and the United States McEwan, technical adviser on behalf of their respective governments, With a completely different mood to sign the final inspection report on the results. Inspection report, wrote: \"Through thorough examination of all containers in the &#39;Milky Way&#39; ships, the results show that the ship did not contain thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride, two chemicals. The U.S. Government&#39;s commitment to the notice of the inspection results to the Chinese freighter &#39;Milky Way&#39; scheduled port of call of Governments, and efforts to ensure that the &#39;Milky Way&#39; freighter smooth entry into the port of discharge. \"<br> At this point, the so-called Chinese\" Milky Way \"freighter transported to Iran dangerous chemical weapons precursor events truth finally revealed to the world. <br> since August 3, the \"Milky Way\" the ship underway normal international commercial shipping freight liner unjustly aggrieved, was forced to suspend the normal shipping for up to 33 days as long as the cause of the Chinese people&#39;s concerns. Final inspection report also finally Galaxy innocence, the situation seems to be started to subside. However, There are still many problems in people&#39;s minds: \"Milky Way\" event happening? The aboard the ordinary freighter Why actually caused such an uproar in the world? Why this incident lasted for such a long time? After the incident, (lssdjt.cn) people should draw any conclusions? <br> With these questions, the reporter recently interviewed directly responsible and involved in the processing of the officials of the relevant departments of the \"Milky Way\" event learned insider as follows: <br> hearsay evidence <br> July 23 Day, U.S. Embassy officials suddenly an emergency meeting with the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials, declared: the United States to obtain precise information, the Chinese cargo ship \"Milky Way\" on July 15 from Dalian Port loaded with the manufacture of chemical weapons precursors ( raw materials) thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride, was heading for the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The U.S. government asked the Chinese government to take immediate measures to stop the export behavior, otherwise, we must follow their own domestic law sanctions against China. August 3, in the United States once again to negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went so far as to ignore national sovereignty shall not be violated basic principles must not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, the command \"Milky Way\" return to the departure point of the Chinese government;, or by the United States boarding and inspection of goods, in order to identify the ship contains chemicals; or simply stay in one place, and let&#39;s pleasure. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> In fact, prior to the negotiations in the United States, that is, since 1 August, two U.S. warships had already begun in the \"Milky Way\" Hang bit about each two sea miles The track at the U.S. aircraft continue to hover over the Galaxy reconnaissance camera. U.S. warships, aircraft harassment seriously affect the normal navigation of the \"Milky Way\". August 3, the \"Milky Way\" was forced to suspend forward in the seas broke down more than a dozen nautical miles from the Strait of Hormuz. <br> At the same time, the United States spread to the Gulf countries, the the above alarmist \"intelligence\" Western media of the United States \"found\" much rendering, began to say that the \"Milky Way\" contains sensitive chemicals, then added loaded with chemical weapons, and even carrying nuclear weapons. \"Milky Way\" seem to have become a \"plague\" of the ship. <br> careful investigation <br> Americans said the \"intelligence\" to \"true\". Although China has explicitly prohibit, restrict the provisions of such chemicals, however, does not lightly be denied immediately, but take seriously the attitude. China authorities Galaxy Maru \", including the goods 12 days of earnest, thorough and comprehensive investigation to identify the ship details. <br> findings proved that the so-called U.S. \"intelligence\" is full of loopholes. Let me talk about the ship: \"Milky Way\" is a container liner Guangzhou, China Ocean Shipping Company Middle East routes, fixed routes Tianjin Xingang - Shanghai - Hong Kong - Singapore - Jakarta - Dubai - Dammam & mdash ; Kuwait. Launch on July 7, starting from Tianjin Xingang to Shanghai, the 12th to go to Hong Kong from Shanghai, originally scheduled port calls in Singapore and Jakarta on August 3 after arriving in Dubai. Can be seen, the wheel is impossible to set sail from Dalian Port plans did not proceed to any port in Iran. The United States said that the destination of the \"Milky Way\" Iran&#39;s Bandar Abbas, but the Hong Kong no Container Terminal, \"Galaxy,\" where they can do it? Say goods: carefully checked by the relevant \"Galaxy\" cargo manifests and bills of lading, shippers verification, \"Milky Way\" indeed contain cargo destined for Iran, a total of 30 containers, mainly some stationery, hardware, machine parts and dye. These goods and \"Milky Way\" other goods contained in the 80% originally planned to be unloaded in the port of Dubai, United Arab Emirates transporter. As to the U.S. side referred to the wheel mount of thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride, no. U.S. intelligence forces are strong, said to be able to do \"perspicacious. However, around the Galaxy, \"the so-called\" precise information \"could be so bad actually so convinced by the decision-makers in the United States, which is really surprising. My two chemical thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride, according to the chemical experts the thiodiglycol of syrupy colorless transparent liquid, mainly used for the production of preservatives, pesticides, herbicides and cotton fabric stains, can also be used to manufacture the pen oil. Thionyl chloride is a colorless or light yellow liquid, mostly used in organic synthesis, dyes, pesticides and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Some countries of these two chemicals used for military purposes, for example, made of mustard gas and other chemical warfare agents. Signed in January this year, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) provides that the transfer should be subject to the control of these two chemicals. According to the relevant person in charge, the Chinese government early in 1990 on the development of measures of prohibitions and restrictions. Therefore, the so-called large quantities of thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride is impossible to appear in \"Galaxy\" cargo. <br> solemn representations <br> August 4, China&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. side on China&#39;s findings, pointed out that the so-called U.S. \"intelligence\" serious misrepresentation to the U.S. side has made solemn representations, pointed out that China chemical exports has consistently adopted a prudent and responsible attitude, very strict export control regime, never export of chemicals for the purpose of manufacturing chemical weapons and technology and equipment. U.S. baseless allegations China \"Galaxy\" cargo exports to Iran two chemical weapons precursors, and wanton interference with normal commercial navigation of the ship, is groundless. Representations, China has also asked the United States to take immediate measures to stop everything to obstruct or interfere with the activities, and to ensure that the \"Milky Way\" into the respective port of discharge. The (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> However, faulty intelligence in the United States and hegemonic practices has resulted in serious consequences. \"Milky Way\" were trapped on the high seas in the Gulf region. On board at this time in oil, water shortages, much-needed supplies. The evening of August 4, the multi-party negotiations, the arrangements, the relevant authorities of the United Arab Emirates generously decided to help, sent a tug approaching the \"Milky Way\", its plus fuel oil and fresh water, 60 tons. But even this point, the United States went so far as near Iranian boat forward \"Milky Way\", and warned that the \"Galaxy\" not to be driven into the Iranian port. multiplied obstacles <br> due to the United States, the \"Milky Way\" Permission to enter the port of discharge problems remain unresolved. Qin, China&#39;s Assistant Foreign Minister, ordered an urgent meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy, lodged a strong protest against the high-handed behavior of the United States of the \"Milky Way\" taken on August 7. Qin stressed that the action in the state-to-state relations, in accordance with the so-called intelligence trumped another sovereign state, is a violation of the norms of international relations and international law. U.S. action unprovoked damage China&#39;s international image, interfering with the normal shipping Chinese vessels, destruction of normal relations and trade between sovereign states, causing serious economic losses to the Chinese side, so that the safety of Chinese ships and their personnel under serious threat, and to cast a new shadow over Sino-US relations. China strongly urges the United States to take immediate measures to ensure that the \"Milky Way\" smooth as planned to rely on the port of discharge; compensation and responsibility for all the losses caused by the requirements of the United States its unreasonable practice and consequences, and to ensure that they will no longer interfere with the Chinese merchant normal shipping and commercial activities. case <br> repeatedly lodged solemn representations with the Chinese side, the United States still stubbornly clinging to the so-called \"intelligence\" and hold. On August 12, the United States, a senior official still declared: \"We have reliable intelligence proved (\" Galaxy \") on board to have chemical weapons. We are determined to carry out checks on the ship. \"<br> To tell the truth to the international community in order to use the fact that, as soon as possible to resolve the\" Milky Way \"blocked, to avoid China and parties shippers suffered more serious losses, and the crew of the\" Milky Way \"less afflicted China as early as August 4 to the United States by a third country with China, to inspect the goods to the Galaxy. After much effort, the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its willingness to accept China&#39;s \"Milky Way\" the freighter entered its Dammam, with Saudi Arabia on behalf of a check by the China Inspection Unit. The United States will send experts as the technical adviser of Saudi participation in inspections. On August 25, the \"Milky Way\" adrift on the high seas more than 20 days, finally arrived in Saudi Dammam, pending inspection. <br> the inspection turmoil <br> August 26, Saudi Arabia, China, the United States third-party inspectors has arrived in Dammam near Port Zhu Kohler naval base by the host Saudi Arabia Representative Zhu Kohler, commander of the naval base in Iraq²·À­ÐÁ×¼½« chaired the first round of the 3-way talks. Saudi Arabia proposed a draft inspection procedures, up to nine hours of negotiations, reached by agreement: review of the \"Galaxy\" cargo list to identify the goods destined for Iran and visual inspection; doubt cartons, can be removed for the box inspection; After the inspection, the sand, in the United States to sign the report on the results and announce to the world. <br> 28 morning 8:00, the representatives of the three parties together came to the pier. 10 am, the temperature rose to 65 degrees Celsius in the sun, check the start. Over the years the first time have the opportunity to check the Chinese vessels of U.S. personnel, some dressed in desert camouflage uniforms, some wear gas masks, carrying a variety of instruments, it seems that soon confirmed their \"intelligence\" . Container destined for Iran&#39;s first open, in front of people, buckets of the seal black paint cans. Americans ecstatic. However, the open after the discovery of colorful dye. Since then, a series of open containers destined for Iran 23, just inside China in Beijing, told their stationery, hardware and mechanical parts, with the exception of the United States looking for the two chemicals. <br> result of this check is clearly not the U.S. side hope. Faced with the immediate results, the U.S. experts began to know what to do. In order to prove their intelligence correctly, they propose to expand the scope of the inspection and check out of the box 6 boxes of goods re-exports from Hong Kong destined for Iran. Saudi technical advisory capacity to participate in the U.S. inspectors check, regardless of their own identity, personally rummaging, the result is still nothing. At this time, the United States asked to check out of the box 19 boxes of goods shipped to countries outside of Iran to China, the result is the same. Later, the United States whenever you see a liquid canned goods, they Yigai not miss sampling were all sent to the laboratory analysis. The U.S. In order to show the importance of laboratory tests, laboratory reagents are all specifically from U.S. warships sent. However, the results of the test are getting the Americans embarrassed. Shipped on board Coca-Cola, the Americans must be sent for testing the joke. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> open container increasing number of Americans are looking for is still not. However, they can not be reconciled, more ready to accept that, even unilaterally tore up the agreements reached, no reason to check all the goods on board, including the inspection of goods but also out of the box from the bottom of the third country. <br> China Inspection Unit requires the United States to provide justification for expanding the scope of the inspection. Outside the United States in addition to over and over again \"Washington is convinced that on board there are two chemicals, always unable to provide any evidence. The U.S. side is responsible for the final simply \"Frank said Washington even though offered no evidence, but also suspect that the goods contained in the\" Milky Way \", including goods shipped from third countries, such as Japan and Singapore, and blackmail said, not let the U.S. side to check all the goods, the United States will not recognize the results of the final inspection. on <br> 9 May 1, 2009, China&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials urgent meeting with U.S. Embassy officials, contrary to the promise of the United States, made representations treachery, articulate against the United States to interfere in the position of goods from third countries, such checks should by the United States to bear the consequences arising therefrom. Also asked the United States: a written examination results has been made so far to be recognized, and that all 49 boxes of goods sent from China, the United States alleged chemicals; Second, the commitment to the completion of the \"Milky Way\" contained in cargo inspection, together with representatives of China, Saudi sign the report of inspection results. <br> the truth <br> is to prevent the U.S. side renewable trouble, overthrow the inspection results, the person in charge of the China Inspection Unit signed by the three parties to confirm the daily inspection records. Justice under the pressure, the United States had to accept this proposal. Since then, thiodiglycol and thionyl chloride column on the daily inspection record sheets, neatly arranged play a bunch of \"no\" words, the bottom line is the 3 representatives different text signature. <br> 9 \"Galaxy\" cargo ship&#39;s first 782 is the last cargo box is checked and The result of the check on the cargo box is exactly the same, with the first cargo box. The United States under the banner of the name of preventing the proliferation of chemical weapons, an attempt to grasp the handle, tarnished the reputation of China last glimmer of hope, completely shattered. The (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> the same day, in the sand, the United States representatives to check all cargo inspection report was signed. <br> in the 1990s, such as the United States, a self-proclaimed country advocating a \"rule of law\" and \"democracy\", even in the world, so whatever they want. If this continues, there will be the number of cargo ships like the \"Milky Way\" fate befell? World what axiom at all? <br>'
