'cont'=>'October 7, 1995 (, seeing in leap August 13), a successful trial in China \"ocean floor detection system.\" <br> 1995 10 major national high-tech research and development projects, the ocean floor detection system test task was completed. <br> According to reports, this trial completion of the five years ahead of schedule, and exceeded the target of more than a dozen times. The successful test of this system, our ability to detailed probing of the waters of the world&#39;s oceans ninety-seven% area in addition to trench outside accounting. <br> ocean floor detection system water communications, high pressure sealing, signal acquisition, autonomous navigation control, power systems and a variety of specialty materials and other issues need to be addressed. This test not only the successful completion of the task, also approved by the United Nations of 150,000 km2 exclusive Pioneer Area ocean floor for polymetallic nodules detection provides advanced technical means, collected information. <br> this trial is successful, to make China one of the few countries of the world has developed the ability of this device to provide a strong technical means for the development of marine resources in China. <br>'
