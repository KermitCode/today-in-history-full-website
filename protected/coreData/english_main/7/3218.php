'cont'=>'April 7, 2002 (on February 25), Imo, &#39;SG II giant lasers successfully developed. <br> 2002, \"SG II giant lasers successfully developed. The advent of \"SG II, marking the high power laser research and laser fusion research has been advanced in the world. At present, such a giant laser precision that only a few countries such as the United States, Japan construction. \"SG II overall technical performance has entered the world&#39;s top five. <br> built in Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, \"SG II\", hundreds of optical devices for integration in the size of a football field empty. <br> room. 8 beam of intense laser three-dimensional arrangement of the amplification chain gathered in a small fuel target ball through space, equivalent to the global grid power sum of the multiples of the powerful power emitted within a nanosecond ultrashort instant , thus releasing the extreme pressure and high temperatures to trigger a fusion reaction. <br>'
