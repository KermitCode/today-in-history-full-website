'cont'=>'March 7, 1914 (February 11) Jiayin, born the Chinese nuclear agronomy founder Xu Guanren. <br> the Xu Guanren born \"target =\" _blank \"> Xu Guanren (1914.3.7-2004.2.18), famous nuclear agronomist. Nantong, Jiangsu Province County in 1934 graduated from the Central University Department of Agronomy, 1950 doctorate from the University of Minnesota. elected in 1980 as the Chinese Academy of Sciences academician (Academy of Sciences). former University of Minnesota Department of agronomy and plant genetic researcher, researcher at the Institute deputy director, director, honorary director of Atomic Energy, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences concurrently Beijing Agricultural University, Professor, Head of the Department of Agricultural physical meteorology researcher at the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Biology Department deputy director, acting director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute for Plasma Physics consultant, chairman of the China Atomic Energy Society of Agronomy, honorary chairman, honor The chairman of the Atomic Energy agricultural applications, \"Nuclear Agricultural Sciences Editor-in-Chief. early in Rice Genetic (on TodayOnHistory.com) different types of hybrid rice and infertility genetic research, won the Prize of Natural Science Papers. generation and expression of heterosis in maize research in the United States during the proposed new point of view, the use of the thermal neutron and X-ray processing wheat stem rust resistance mutations kinds of new ways of breeding for disease resistance at that time that, by international attention. After returning home in 1956, is committed to the application of nuclear technology in agriculture, to create China&#39;s first atomic energy utilization in agriculture research institutions initiated and set up the China Atomic Energy Society of Agronomy, founder of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences, the Nuclear Agricultural Sciences. The use of radiation-induced genetic variation theory and research methods, and promote the national utilization of heterosis the wheat single nullisomic the reorganization of the genetic structure of the (history today www.lssdjt.com) radiation breeding and development of chromosome engineering to promote nuclear technology in a large agricultural the application. <br> major works include \"hybrid sorghum male sterile line breeding,\" the application of nuclear science and technology in crop breeding, plant mutation breeding and Introduction to Nuclear agronomy, \"< ; br> Xuguan Ren, the famous Crop Genetics breeders and Atomic Energy agronomist, the founder of China&#39;s nuclear agronomy his first sorghum cytoplasmic male sterile line introduced into China, bred the first sorghum CMS lines and original new No. 1 \"excellent combination for our sorghum heterosis use to make an important contribution; advocacy radiation-induced hybridization combined in a variety of crops, new varieties bred for the production of large-area of &#8203;&#8203;radiation breeding technology to go crop research, promote the use of the lake the water suspended cultivation of rice in the world; initial success. <br>'
