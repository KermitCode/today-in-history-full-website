'cont'=>'May 7, 1997 (, Landmarks April day), bright project implementation. <br> 1997, determined by the state \"Bright Project\" has entered the implementation phase, in five years there will be 800 million people without electricity poverty to become the first beneficiaries of this project. (History cn) <br> \"Bright Project\" through the development of wind, solar and other new energy, a new generation for those areas without electricity from the grid to provide energy for changes in local poverty and backwardness conditions. (History of this program. Cn) \"Bright Project\" in areas without electricity in the world to implement the initiative put forward by the Chinese government in response to the World Solar Summit held in Zimbabwe in 1996 to develop . At present, China has 76.56 million people without electricity, 16 without electricity County, 29,783 villages without electricity, these populations and regions far from the grid, the load is small and scattered, unable to power grid extension. Without electricity is a major constraint on economic development. <br> According to the National Planning Commission, who introduced the rich, China&#39;s wind power, solar energy resources, wind energy can be developed total 253 million kilowatts, the region for more than 2000 hours of annual sunshine time is 2/3 of the total land area. Through self-development and the introduction of technology at the same time, China has been able to provide a variety of supporting wind power generation equipment to lay the technical foundation for the implementation of the \"Bright Project\". It is reported that, \"Bright Project\" will soon choose wind power as a breakthrough. The goal is to use of wind power in 2010, China has a population of 23 million wind areas without electricity supply. The first target will be completed in five years 2000 villages without electricity, the 100 microwave communication station, wind power systems, such as the construction, the total installed capacity from 40 to 600,000 kilowatts, can that 800 million people without electricity for 1/10 of the country ushered in bright. <br>'
