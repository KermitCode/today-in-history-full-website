Berzelius parents farmers he was 4 years old when his father died of illness, the mother changed with his 2-year-old sister was married to a pastor. Berzelius mother died two years later. lucky own stepfather of five children of brother and sister just like with children of their own culture, education to them. pastor was not rich, but soon he is still trying to raise a large sum of money for the seven children, please a knowledgeable tutor to tutor kids education minister paid great attention to meet the children&#39;s curiosity, often specifically for the purpose of education and led them to go on an outing there are a variety of small river plants, crystal clear water, fish can swim spit bubbles, shrimp, small crabs in the cobblestone drill to touch throughout the year by a small river of the same scenery, for the children, along the creek Travel is undoubtedly a very attractive game. Berzelius prefer this kind of travel, especially stepfather often observe things be pointing to him and help. Gradually, he began to wholeheartedly love nature, and sometimes Then he lay down on the soft grass by the river, looking up at the white clouds in the sky, and he seemed to feel part of nature. <br> 1793, 14-year-old Berzelius entered Linche level secondary school. complicated social science courses, learn from him is not very hard; natural science courses, he showed great interest, often collecting specimens of a variety of plants, animals, and like to go hunting. under the guidance of a new natural history teachers for academic travel back just returned from the West Indies, Berzelius began to carry out a systematic study of the region&#39;s flora and fauna Linche level in the entire secondary stage, he gave teachers the impression is: a good talent, ambition widely but the temper very eager young man <br> graduating from high school, Berzelius want to be able to continue their studies, the stepfather agreed to his request in September 1796, Berzelius, 17-year-old came to Uppsala?? ancient university city of Sweden. then he passed the entrance exam to become a student of the University of Uppsala. due stepfather unable to provide more funds for his so his life is quite hard in order to make their own life situation has changed, Berzelius went to someone else as a tutor, although quite meager income, but this self-reliant life cultivated his strong will and labor-loving character. to Berzelius and began to teach himself French, German, and English classes in order to give the children of immigrants from different countries, it is precisely because of this self-study experiences, so knowledge of these languages &#8203;&#8203;in his later use of the big multi-language study of various academic works help <br> 1798 fall, college students Berzelius get a scholarship, so he will have ample time to study what they like to make a living without having to run around quickly, he passed the professional?? medical philosophy exam until then, the Berzelius himself after his life engaged in career?? chemistry, not yet much interest (on TodayOnHistory.com) <br> culminated Berzelius use his energy chemistry is an exam subjects exam junior year in college, he the chemical score came in the last of the class, but for other excellent academic performance, he is likely to be expelled from the then on, unwilling ranking after Berzelius began to take the initiative to learn chemistry At this point, the young began to study the German chemist Jitannier textbooks \"anti-phlogiston chemistry fundamentals. ($ dj¦Ó.c¨­m), which is a user-friendly textbook. Berzelius later recalled, is the study this book, his interest in chemistry is becoming increasingly strong, his mind filled with a variety of chemical experiments and chemical knowledge. <br> time, Lavoisier&#39;s oxygen theory is deep into the chemical theories and began to replace the outdated phlogiston theory. engaged in a fierce debate between the advocates of the doctrine of phlogiston theory and Lavoisier dominant in the Swedish scientific community or the phlogiston theory, the the Berzelius teachers all believe in the old perspectives, the students accepted the doctrine of Lavoisier. Berzelius prepared in the laboratory a large amount of oxygen and oxygen in the combustion experiments of various substances, often in front of classmates For these students, so that they recognize the the Lavoisier oxygen doctrine earliest experimental continuous experimentation, Berzelius deepened interest in chemistry at the University of Uppsala, chemical has not been much attention, and there was little which college students want dedicated devotion to the discipline being. Berzelius fell in love with the chemical, and began efforts to solve their own research problems in certain chemical phenomena the summer of 1799, he spent in a glass shop, where he told an Italian learning welding glass and glassware manufacturing artistry The laboratory work extremely important skills in the future to make his students always amazed. winter this year, an assistant to a doctor to Medina dimensional mineral water springs, the winter of 1800, Berzelius Medina dimensional mineral water, chemical analysis, and as the subject of his dissertation. <br> this time in the electrical aspects of the Italian partner sent clear to produce a continuous current of voltaic cell. quickly learn to accept new things Berzelius also created a volt hit the battery and used to study current physiology and medical utility. use of this device, he succeeded in making one the Disabled of a disease hand to restore flexibility. these experiments, the experience became the basis of his doctoral thesis in May 1802, Berzelius at the University of Uppsala public doctorate thesis, which completed all required received his medical doctorate. In the same year, the Royal Swedish Medical Association appointed Berzelius, who just turned 23 years old Stockholm School of Medicine and Pharmacy Lecturer From then on, he began his teaching career. <br> 1807, 28-year-old Tony mining Julius was appointed professor of chemistry and pharmacy, he taught at the School of Medicine of the Medical Department at this time only three professors, so that each professor to open several course. the Berzelius opened is medicine, botany and pharmacy courses soon after he opened a chemistry class at the beginning, his pharmacy class welcomed very popular with students, but to listen to his chemistry class, but few this is because, at the time a professor of chemistry focus only on their lectures, and lectures do not usually make any demonstration and experimental pedagogy of this chemical is traditional in many universities. verbal comment on the nature and composition of the various substances, but not for chemical reaction intuitive experiment , not only to teach, it is difficult for students, so abstract chemistry class is very boring people think. chemistry class unwelcome also can imagine. <br> Tony mining Julius tries to change this situation. lectures, he greatly increased the number of experiments, intuitive chemistry experiment into classroom instruction. Soon, his chemistry class classroom gradually crowded with students come to lectures. his chemical pedagogy also quickly adopted by many other universities during intensive teaching activities at the same time, Berzelius also actively engaged in research activities in 1802, he carried out the study of electrochemical In February 1803, he will research results be summarized as a paper, this paper includes all the basic principles of the theory of Berzelius electrochemical same year Berzelius, their chemists He new Nightingale conducting the compound decomposes research process, co-discovered a new chemical element cerium also accurately determine the nature of this new substance. previously unknown 24-year-old Jacob? Tony mining inside ust a name in the chemical industry <br> 1806? the 1818, Berzelius He new Nightingale, edited and published the journal \"Physical, chemical and mineralogical Series, this publication in physics, chemistry deepening sector, Berzelius often own research published in this publication. in 1806, Berzelius yourself to write a textbook of physiological chemistry in this year, he the first introduction of the concept of \"organic\" teaching in 1808, he set out to write a book of \"chemistry textbook, a textbook for future generations of chemists in many countries learned make a huge contribution to the development of science from the start of 1807, after six years, he also conducted a study of the basis for determination of various salts, acids, oxides and other substances. <br> Berzelius huge contribution to the scientific community and the education sector in 1808, he was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810 and was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences. heavy workload Berzelius for all honor and not take it too seriously, he is still down-to-earth to conduct their own research and teaching work. <br> as a scientist, Berzelius paid great attention to the latest scientific research to understand the world, he actively foreign scientists in constant contact, which further extends the breadth and depth of his scientific views or in early scientific activities, he has been with many well-known scholars, such as Bell Toledo, David French people to establish communication links, the summer of 1812, Berzelius invitation of the president of the Royal Society, David, visited the Royal Society, through the introduction of David, he also became acquainted with the many distinguished representative of the Society in the future 5 months, Berzelius with David a common chemical research, and achieved a consensus on many issues, and correct each other some of the other erroneous views, further deepened his academic links with David in the spring of 1818 , the Berzelius due to fatigue sick, doctors and friends have suggested him to temporarily stop chemical research to foreign travel infirmary. he obeyed the exhortation, made a long time to travel abroad, visited the United Kingdom, France , Switzerland and Germany during the trip, he met many universities in Europe and he spent 10 months in Paris, France, and the French scholars mutual exchange research topics, Berzelius get the many very useful revelation in October 1820, he returned to Stockholm, and started a new scientific research. <br> The Berzelius, has become a world-renowned scholar of his study a very wide range of chemical big problem is almost no one did not participate in the study the <br> To better summarize the scientific development of the time, from 1821, he set to work published in the \"physical, chemical progress report\" until his death, the Annual Report published a total of 27 period, these annual reports about chemistry, physics and mineralogy of the last half of the 19th century the most authoritative Digest publication. <br> Berzelius ahead with the publication of annual reports, and gave himself a widely publicized scientific achievements lofty goals, he believes that his efforts will certainly be able to promote the development of production and help to promote the welfare of the people in its annual report on behalf of the Academy of Sciences for the first midterm wrote: \"We rely on the scientific papers or reports continue to publish, the intelligentsia of the country is likely to achieve its ultimate purpose?? further understanding of the progress of human knowledge, and more emphasis on practical science research to broader application of the results of their research to ordinary, beneficial to go to the artistry and craftsmanship of the workers, so that you will be able to promote the production of prosperity and the improvement of the living standards of workers. \"<br> Berzelius proposed second task is through this Digest sexual publications to unite the forces of scientists from various countries, to promote the development of science and the cause he pointed out that the publication of the annual report is not only conducive to summarize the work have been, but also for a new subject to study. (L $ dj¦Ó . c¨­m) <br> \"Annual Report\" published a total of 27 installments are a thick, up a 800 body in the editing of the \"Annual Report\", Berzelius than just excerpt voluminous scientific treatises, he sought one of the most important scientific development of singled out this passage: he once said, \"from the science garden picking fruit, is the same as the farmers harvest, often working , co-product of the fortunate and favorable opportunities associated with the former only in the day-to-day to collect the facts, so science forward is always slow. Scientific sometimes taken pace than usual, in most cases, this is a very good pace to take advantage of the opportunities result sometimes is rare genius outstanding research results. like °®¶ûË¹½ÝÌØ discovered electromagnetic effects; the thermoelectric phenomenon Ji BAK studies; Faraday discovered electromagnetic polarimetry; dense Kerr special forces found objects isomorphous the phenomenon; µÂ²®À³Äù¶û found platinum to cause gasification together at room temperature until the nature of the ignition ... all this science has taken the extremely rare tremendous pace. (historical Today www.lssdjt.com) O <br> eighteen years, the Department of Medicine at the University of Stockholm one can teach chemistry lecturer, he went to apply to be admitted immediately. Berzelius learned that he had inadvertently discovery of new elements, is a very important academic achievements. eighteen O, he was for students to write a chemistry textbook, revised again and again, 15 years later, went out publishing this book came to be translated into French, German, English, and universities in Europe and the United States widely use. <br> eighteen O eight, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) Berzelius analysis of blood found heme iron, and analysis food contains a lot of iron found in spinach, so he suggested to eat spinach can improve physical strength, and to promote the generation of the blood of this research was ridiculed by many: spinach green, blood red, eat green How can complement the red? Berzelius did not argue what he continues to study the physiological and metabolic chemical reaction. he does not know he is on an important subject physiological chemistry. eighteen O and 1995, he wrote: The human brain the function of the greatest mysteries of the large nature, many chemical action in the meantime, as long as there is a chemical role in the problem, the people will be mad; whenever untie a small chemical reaction in the brain, is towards understanding God big step. <br> soon, Berzelius: cause muscle soreness is lactic acid, not acetic acid he found that lactic acid difference in optical left-handed and right-handed molecules have the same molecular formula, but different structure of the arrangement, he called isomers (isomerism) in 1817, he was in the the smelting the galena furnace of underground residue analysis of a new element, he named selenium (the Selenium) The original intent of the word is the moon, because selenium distinguish from the slag, as the moon separated from the earth in general. Later he discovered a new element and from Norway named? pit on its take called? (Thorium). <br> 1818, Berzelius his most famous research atomic weight set when he studied the various elements of the oxide, each element go to weight, the proportion composed of various substances, per mole of oxygen atoms 16 weight based set forty-five kinds of known atomic weight of the element in 1826, he set in Latin symbols of various atoms and discharge atomic weight table, which is the the earliest atomic weight set their periodic table why chemical elements use Latin? Berzelius: day-to-day use of the word will change over time and its wording meaning of nonverbal Latin but can leave the original meaning. <br> Berzelius his life dedicated to science, he was 56 years old before the first marriage of his wife, Johanna, then only 24 years old, Sweden a daughter, of Secretary of State Bopiwusi&#39;s premarital Berzelius granted in the baronetcy, when they married, they held a luxurious wedding. government officials, scientists, and celebrities, as well as his students said to them congratulations. marriage, Berzelius continue to be immersed in the research work. while he lectures at the university, while stay in the lab work, and taking the time to write, \"Annual Review 1836, he was still the physics and chemistry Yearbook\" published a paper in the journal, first proposed the concept of \"catalytic\" and \"catalyst\" used in the chemical reaction; he, in 1841 first proposed allotrope term. even if the the Berzelius chemical achievements have been internationally famous, but the economy is still very constraints his long residence in a basement, the room is small enough, and still some students to discuss homework with him at night too late by sleeping in the living room. Berzelius sleep snoring, but these students become accustomed to. the Berzelius wife Bo Bier (ElisabethPoppius), is the daughter of the pastor of his church when the bride honeymoon returned soon found that the husband&#39;s home almost seat beggars houses, more than twenty students sleep on in every corner of the outstanding dishes, clothes tall stacked a couple have hands with clean-up. <br> The couple later had no children, they raise a child put students when these students have a lot of future to the fore as a chemist, for example, the first synthetic urea Weiler (Wohler), iron ore found new element lithium ( lithium) Yawei Sen (Arfwedson), found a new element vanadium (vanadium) schaffer Princeton (Sefstrom), discovered a new element variegate (lanthanum), Bangladesh shan music (Mosander), and the discovery of new elements? (holmium) and manganese (thulium) Nelson (Nilsson). <br>, Berzelius wrote that: in my eyes, the student is more important than any achievement. As for me, I just woke up to see the head ceiling foot floor meet. <br> Berzelius In his later years, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences published last speech said: I am full of gratitude to God, I think he is the happiest man he died of August 7, 1848. due to long-term stress work and frequent exposure to toxic chemicals, Berzelius health suffered great damage, overwork, died on August 7, 1848, in Stockholm, at the age of 69 years old. Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish government held a grand funeral for him. <br> ¢Ù in the development of atomism Wing Adams &#8226; Jacob Berzelius, that should be first of all, in order to establish the atomic theory as much as the atomic weight of the element. measured with the greatest accuracy in 1814, he published the atomic weight table contains 41 elements, and in 1818 increased to 45 elements in 1826 and increased to 50 elements in a table actually values &#8203;&#8203;now (in addition to the alkali metal and silver values &#8203;&#8203;modern values &#8203;&#8203;2 times), he discovered several new elements: cerium (1803), selenium (1817), thorium (1828) He also proposed a new element symbol system, still in use (2) in an electrochemical Wing Adams &#8226; Jacob Berzelius, 1814 electrochemical dualism: the different compounds by two electrical properties (ie, with a positive charge and negative constitute the components of the charge), pioneered the exploration of the relationship between each atom in the molecule in the study of the characteristics of metal and non-metallic, and explain the of inorganic compounds nature and preparation process to be successful. <br> ¢Û in organic chemistry aspects Wing Adams &#8226; Jacob Berzelius, in 1806 first proposed the \"organic\" name he found racemic tartaric acid, and tartaric acid because it has the same chemical composition, but different physical properties recognize isomerism, and named in 1835, he found a catalyst, and name. <br> ¢Ü in analytical chemistry, Wing Adams &#8226; Jacob &#8226; Tony Cely ust founding weight. (lssjt.cn) Wing Sri Lanka &#8226; Jacob &#8226; Berzelius, the earliest the isolated silicon (1810), tantalum (1824) and zirconium (1824); detailed study of the tellurium The compound of the compound (1834) and metals (vanadium, molybdenum, tungsten, etc.), he greatly improved analytical method (using hoses, water bath, a drier, bottle washing, the filter paper, the blowpipe analysis) and combustion analysis (1814). chemical field of China Film frames <br> Berzelius hoon, he first advocated element symbols to represent the various chemical elements he proposed, with the Latin name of the chemical element, said elements if the first letter the same on the first two letters of distinction. example: Na Ne, Ca and Cd, Au and A1 ...... etc. This is the chemical element symbol system has been in use since his element symbols, published in 1813 edited by Thomson philosophy Yearbook year later, the same publication, he the author discusses the chemical formula writing rules he various number of atoms in digital standard in the top right corner of the element symbols such as CO2 , of SO2, H20 ... and so on. the Berzelius element symbols and chemical representation than Dalton and others with a small circle in the past, said the method is simple, clear, therefore, soon science community accepted <br> Berzelius or create a distinguished chemist in the field of organic chemistry research. Berzelius in 1814 through accurate experiments confirmed organics also comply with constant composition law of which began on organics The in-depth study. was the first reference to the concept of \"organic\" but because of the scientific conditions, organic chemistry research object can only be extracted from the natural plant and animal organisms, organic matter, organic matter that can only be manufactured from organic matter. gave people a false impression, seems organics are \"living thing\" or \"things of life\", and only in the role of a non-material \"vitality\" to form, but can not chemically synthesized in the laboratory. Obviously (lssdjt.cn) This vitality &#39;and Berzelius electrochemical dualism, bondage Organic Chemistry However, when the 1828 Wheeler artificial After the synthesis of urea, (Lssdjt.com) Berzelius was greatly inspired, he thought he did find silver fulminate and silver cyanate, which is the same two components, the different nature of the substance was mistaken caused due to experimental error. Wheeler after he found that tartaric acid and grape acid has a similar situation, he must put forward a new concept, he said: \"I would suggest the same composition but different nature of the substances referred to as&#39; the same isomeric substances isomeric phenomenon found from theoretical elucidation is an important step towards the development of the material composition and thread constitutive theory, it began the study of the molecular structure of the problem and promote Organic Chemistry. (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> on chemical affinity, Berzelius established electrochemical dualism doctrine, (TodayinHistory.cn) Tony mining Darius the Sri Lanka early years on the electrolysis process done carefully investigated, especially electrolyzer poles of opposite charge attraction and repulsion between charges left him a deep impression, prompting his determination to apply the above point of view of the electrical analysis Xu and chemical reactions of the group of compounds the mechanism after more experiments investigated him in 1811, starting from the point of view of electricity proposed a more reasonable chemical affinity theory that his electric dualism. duality electrical and experimental proof of a salt can be current is the fact that decomposition of alkali and acid to the pH of the concept and the polarity of the electric link, that the base is formed by the oxide of a metal, which with electropositive: the nonmetallic oxides belt electronegative acid can be formed, and also have a gravitational salt formed at work, the result of the interaction between these two oxides such as calcium oxide with electropositive with electronegative, carbon dioxide, calcium carbonate is formed when both interactions. then he will promote this polarity to the elements above, he conceived, each atom with both positive and negative charge, oxygen is negatively charged the strongest elements, potassium is the most electropositive elements, the other elements according to their negatively charged (or the strength of the positively charged) in between. between elements is able to interact them with opposite charges attract each other, for example, negative electric strongest elements oxygen by other elements are attracted and thus with their compound. However, the oxide thus formed is not neutral, they are also charged. because of the different amount of charge can not be completely neutralized. Therefore, as described above, metal oxides with electropositive non-metallic oxides of belt electronegative. always charged, in accordance with the assumed Berzelius Berzelius still charged even after the compound material interaction affinity is attractive electric. electric as a material particle much deeper understanding of nature, this understanding than David merely the appearance. Berzelius chemical and electrical properties of the material are unified in the same material properties, electrical material changes to recognize substances chemical changes, these two changes organically linked to the chemicals, an important ideological development of the understanding of the chemical processes. <br> electrochemical dualism in line with the actual process of electrolysis, fork combine to make salt made a more satisfactory explanation of the concept of affinity of the acid-base and the role of this theory is straightforward, describes many chemical phenomena, chemists can easily understand it, so this theory soon became win the vast majority of chemists endorse the popular theory. Later, with the development of organic chemistry, especially in research substitution reaction, electrochemical dualism was gradually reveal itself defective by the criticism of the people, on behalf of the new doctrine. <br> ; Berzelius was the most famous one of the analytical chemist in the determination of the atomic weight, many new methods of analysis, the analytical chemistry of the introduction of new reagents and new equipment to the unprecedented accuracy of quantitative analysis various analytical operations through meticulous research and improvement, he has pointed out, for example, filtering the fastest in the the funnel cone angle of 60 degrees, and funnel filter paper can not be higher than the edge of the filter paper, otherwise solvent evaporates quickly, so the precipitate washed difficult. Berzelius done long-term system of mineralogy conducted quantitative analysis of minerals, he found that most of the \"the siliceous\" (silica) siliceous Synthesis of compound oxide of a metal thread is the main ingredient of the mineral. Berzelius mineral containing such compounds, named as \"silicates\" and various silicic acid into its component classified this classification still in use in 1814, he published a paper on mineral pure chemical classification, causing the great importance of academia, is immediately translated into English and German. Mineral Research, at the same time, he also found that some new elements. example, in 1803 found that cerium; 1817 found that selenium; 1828 found that thorium also found silicon, francium, tantalum, germanium, and so on. <br> in the development of atomism, Berzelius , should first be measured with the greatest accuracy in order to establish the atomic theory as much as the atomic weight of the element in 1814, he published the atomic weight table contains 41 elements, and increased to 45 elements in 1818, in 1826 to 50 kinds of elements after a table is actually the same values &#8203;&#8203;now (in addition to the value of the alkali metals and silver is modern values &#8203;&#8203;2 times), he discovered several new elements: cerium (1803), selenium (1817), thorium (1828) He also proposed a new element symbol system, still in use today. <br> in electrochemistry, Berzelius 1814 electrochemical dualism: the different compounds by two electrical properties (ie, positively charged and negatively charged) components, and pioneered the exploration of the relationship between each atom in the molecule. study the characteristics of metal and non-metallic, and explain the of inorganic compounds nature and preparation process to be successful. <br> in Organic Chemistry , Berzelius 1806 first proposed \"Organic Chemistry\" this name. he found a racemic tartaric acid, with tartaric acid have the same chemical composition, but different physical properties and understanding to the same the isomerism and named in 1835, he found a catalyst, and name. <br> in analytical chemistry, his founding weight. was the first isolated silicon (1810), tantalum (1824) and zirconium ( 1824); detailed study of tellurium compound (1834) and the compound of the rare metals (vanadium, molybdenum, tungsten, etc.) he greatly improved analytical method (using hoses, water bath, a drier, bottle washing, the filter paper, the blowpipe analysis ) and combustion analysis method (1814). Berzelius <br> Berzelius author of \"chemical Tutorial\" (Volume 2, 1808 to 1812) and \"ratio of the chemical action of the electric and chemical theory\" (1814 ). Berzelius or a chemical educator he attaches great importance to the cultivation of the chemical. chemistry textbook he had edited a total of three volumes in early 1816, shortly after, he incurs translated into French and German. shellfish mining Cornelius before his death, the book in Sweden has published five editions which one is the most complete, the most systematic and most popular chemistry textbooks have read up to 30 years, thousands of young chemists book. Berzelius its extensive knowledge and correct evaluation of the experimental data insight attract scientists constantly transforming the old method to create a new method, and made no secret of all achievements write Beng textbooks to young scholars paved along the easy (history TodayOnHistory.com) Wheeler, a large number of chemists have studied under Berzelius, he is internationally recognized chemical the major writings of one of the authorities.
