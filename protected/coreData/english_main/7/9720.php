'cont'=>'(Bingyin September fourth day), October 7, 1986, the United States invented to prevent nuclear reactor explosion device. <br> 1986, Xinhua News Agency reported: Recently, U.S. researchers invented a nuclear power plant may be out of the failure to prevent the explosion of reactor unit. Reported that the reactor explosion was caused by hydrogen aggregation. Mandrel shell of reactor fuel is zirconium, with the cooling water or steam encounters when it overheated, inevitably produce hydrogen. Oxidation occurs under high temperature conditions, the oxygen atoms in the zirconium with water molecules and become zirconia, it would be free of hydrogen and the hydrogen atoms in the water molecules. The hydrogen together more, the greater the risk of the reactor exploded. This device works is simple: this is an automatic ignition, when the gathering of hydrogen also did not constitute a danger to burn off. This hydrogen igniting device is manufactured with platinum, like cellular, two inches in diameter, with a wire. When the reactor produces sufficient hydrogen, platinum plays a role in the catalytic converter in the car, and heated until the hydrogen ignited, and to avoid the aggregation and explosion of hydrogen. <br>'
