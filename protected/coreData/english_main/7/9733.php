'cont'=>'October 7, 2005 (, Yiyou September fifth day), the third Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge opened to traffic. <br> <br> 2010, the world&#39;s first \"\" arc-shaped steel tower cable-stayed bridge - Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the 7th The official opening. Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, <br> located in the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, about 19 km upstream, total length of 15.6 km, the cross-river bridge is 4,744 meters long, the main bridge span of 648 meters. The completion of the bridge that runs through the East China to the southwest of Shanghai-Chengdu trunk achieved through true sense. deepwater basis of <br> Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is by far the Yangtze River, the water depth of the deepest, construction difficulty largest underwater foundation engineering. Builders and technological research, in the fast-flowing water in a water depth of 50 m, the speed of water up to 3 meters per second, and built 84 meters long, 29 meters wide and 22 meters high dumbbell-shaped Steel Casing and bored piles basis to ensure the smooth progress of the project. <br> 215 meters high in the international arena for the first time the word \"person\" arc-shaped steel structure Sarasota, bright and difficult Mitsuhashi construction. Builders pioneered steel tower segments welding deformation control technology, high-quality production of steel towers, lifting tasks, has accumulated valuable experience for our large bridge engineering steel tower structure design, manufacture, erection. (History cn) <br> Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge construction also achieved three \"Zero\": zero accidents of production safety, clean government zero cases zero regrets quality sampling. <br> It is understood that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge at 12:00 on the 7th, the official opening traffic. Located in the trunk traffic Mitsuhashi opened up a special heavy vehicle lane, which will greatly alleviate the pressure of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge freight. <br>'
