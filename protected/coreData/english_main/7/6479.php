'cont'=>'(June seeing in the tenth), July 7, 1995, the French super spy satellite out of the mountains. <br> After years of painstaking research and France a photographic reconnaissance satellite Helios - 1A \"\" Ariane \"rocket launch on July 7, 1995, France became so Following the United States, Russia and Israel, the country has a reconnaissance satellite in the fourth. <br> \"Titan - 1A\" successfully developed by the widespread concern around the world, because it can help get rid of the control of the United States by France and Europe in the reconnaissance field, the establishment of an independent defense system. <br> reconnaissance satellites occupy an increasingly important position in modern warfare from 1990 to the 1991 Gulf War, is the best example: the United States spent almost all types of reconnaissance satellites, including Scud missiles every move of the Iraqi forces, including a clear picture, they are able to easily win the war. <br> In fact, France early in 1960 had to consider the development of reconnaissance satellites to the observation and analysis of airports, ports, highways, such as the place of military significance. France formally proposed \"the Sa Muluo photographic reconnaissance satellites plan, the Department of Defense in 1977 and 1986 to Titan. <br> experience proves that the past two superpowers information and intelligence is often incomplete and can not often rely on, such as before the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, the United States told France to produce a group shot by a U.S. reconnaissance satellite, the Iraqi military The photos of the target, but refused to use these photos left to the French side. This deeply hurt the French firm determination to develop its own reconnaissance satellites. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> \"Titan - 1A\" is the first of the huge space surveillance network in France is an integral part of. The French photographic reconnaissance satellite system, the first generation of the two satellite ground receiving system and image data analysis system, a total investment of 10 billion francs. Spain and Italy participated in the investment. Soon after, the \"Titan - 1B\" will also be the sky. <br> \"Titan - 1A\" is a photographic reconnaissance satellite, weighing 2.5 tons, run timing flying over the Earth around the sun-synchronous orbit, at an altitude of 400-800 km. It utilizes a civilian satellite technology, such as its \"Spot 4\" multipurpose platform of earth resources satellite and tape recorder, saving one billion francs for the French. <br> eyes that is a full-color image resolution of better than one meter of the camera. The camera point designed with an inclination of 30 ¡ã, can be observed at any point within 950 km terrestrial width reconnaissance, and every two and a half or so to the same region. Known as \"deviate from the nadir observation techniques, observation of the same scene at different angles, and of great benefit to the photographic interpretation armaments verify. <br> Helios satellites observed railways, highways, and prohibits people on the planet into a fence in trucks and horse trailers, civilian vehicles and military jeeps as well as fighter and cargo ships, but also tell. Different kind of photos taken in space with the US-Russian reconnaissance satellites loaded the sealed box Touhui ground way the Titan satellite is a video satellite \", which were observed with the record the sensitive photographic light intensity controller implement information processing by the ground receiving station observations, so get the clarity of the image will be greatly enhanced. <br> Beginning in 2001, France will continue to launch four second-generation Helios satellites. \"Titan-2\" satellite higher performance, except equipped with a visible light camera, it also contains an infrared camera, which day and night observation. <br> In addition, France is developing electronic reconnaissance and photographic reconnaissance satellites containing synthetic aperture radar, which can achieve all-weather, all-time reconnaissance satellite Titan complementary. the <br> France is fast becoming a military space powers, military space arena competition will become more intense. <br>'
