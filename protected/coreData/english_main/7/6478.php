'cont'=>'(Awake, May 29), July 7, 1994, astronomers newly discovered extrasolar planets. the <br> \"Science\" magazine in 1994, an astronomer at the Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Alexander Wirth praise the article says, after more than three years of observations, exist outside the solar system around a distant neutron star rotating evidence of two planets. <br> British \"Times\" that the discovery of two planets indicate that there may be life planets outside our solar system. This distant neutron star called PSR B1257 +12. Running around it two planets 1300 light years from Earth, is located in the constellation Virgo. <br> astronomers have long believed that there extrasolar planet around the star running, but we use a conventional telescope can not see them, can only infer their existence based on the release of radiation for planets around stars. Dr. <br> Walls praise Puerto Rico Arecibo Observatory radio telephoto ytterbium, observing the radio signals of the neutron star, some come early, some come late. This suggests that the neutron star wobble due to the impact of the planets around the far turn. Dr. Friedrich - La Xiao <br> Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, USA commented, \"This is the first time we can be sure that there is a line galaxies outside our own planet. \"<br>'
