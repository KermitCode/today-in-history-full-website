But with the anti-Japanese war entered a stalemate, coupled with the two operations frustration invasion of the Soviet Union (see Hale Xin River Battle, Battle of Lake Hasan), the Japanese high command is deeply at the same time the two sides battle powerless. After the outbreak of World War II, the Japanese high command decided to take advantage of the favorable opportunity to shift to the south and conquering Kitamori guidelines busy with the war in Europe, Britain and France, along with the development of the European war and the signing of the treaty of alliance of Germany, Italy and Japan \".

Such as the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States, the implementation of a comprehensive oil embargo, Japan and the United States increasingly acute contradiction. The United States in order to defend their vested interests in the Asia and Pacific region, to Pearl Harbor as the main base and activity center, set up a one hundred on the huge fleet. <br> Pearl Harbor on the U.S. Pacific naval base. Located in the southern end of the central Pacific island of Oahu (Hawaiian Islands).

Repair yard to protect a variety of ships (including attack aircraft carrier) repair and drydocking. Pearl Harbor&#39;s favorable location to facilitate the naval forces stationed in the ground control central Pacific sea. <br> back in early 1941, the day the United States contradiction when the Japanese Navy proposed the idea of &#8203;&#8203;a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. In August, the Japanese combined fleet commander Admiral Yamamoto Admiral develop specific code-named \"Z\" war plan of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and formally approved by the Japanese stronghold on October. The central link of this plan is carried out surprise attacks from the air, violently attack the main force of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. <br> order the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese Command sent an aircraft carrier group (6 carrier carrying 353 aircraft, two battleships, three cruisers, 11 destroyers, three submarines, eight oil tankers) and a pre-expanded submarine fleet in the Hawaiian Islands waters (27). Battle of attempts: aircraft carrier group covertly after the completion of the rough seas, the mothership air force sudden-intensive assault on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. naval vessels, shore facilities and aircraft. Aviation action at the same time, it also plans to use the 5 small submarine sent from the mother submarine warfare waters. This submarine&#39;s mission is to sneak into the aviation assault on the eve of Pearl Harbor, the battleship torpedo attack. The two destroyers as an aircraft carrier battle groups in the the feint assault - the shelling of the air base on Midway. the Battle of <br> Pearl Harbor is carefully planned and prepared for military, repeated on the job and the sand table exercise, also Saeki Bay battleship goal conducted the attacks rehearsal; strengthen security measures strictly limited war plan , command documents circulated range, control of the war correspondence of the officers and men; assault fleet to maintain radio silence, other ships and aircraft in the Inland Sea of &#8203;&#8203;Japan has frequent radio contact, also organized a large number of sailors tour to Tokyo; instruction Consul-General of Japan in Hawaii to be The military attache, consul, Japanese expatriates and various reconnaissance tools, especially Oahu Pearl Harbor base from the ground, air, sea, underwater reconnaissance activities; over 70 million people in China&#39;s northeast border areas build Kwantung Army, engaged in a time to prepare military exercises north.

Roosevelt proposed peace talks, to and appointed known as Roosevelt friendship Admiral Nomura for Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United States; Hideki Tojo came to power after playing the peace talks scam, said To eliminate the hostility between the two sides, to stop the war in Europe spread to the Far East. These measures have created favorable conditions for the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. military completely beaten in a passive position.

Favorable target of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, in addition to the departure of the aircraft carrier, the inner harbor of ships and aircraft on the airport intensive docked together, become attacks. The air defense of the U.S. ships are the same throughout the Pearl Harbor base, all did not do a good job to prepare to fight the Japanese assault. December 7, most of the crew the holiday go ashore. <br> 12, 2009, the first wave of Japanese aircraft (40 torpedo planes, 49 dive bombers, 51 level bombers and 43 fighters, led by Yuan Tian Mizuno male) took off from the aircraft carrier. 7:55, launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, all large ships and aircraft on the airport.
