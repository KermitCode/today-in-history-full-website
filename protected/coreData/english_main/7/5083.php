'cont'=>'In (Yi Chou, April 19), June 7, 1985, the U.S. Department of Defense developed gallium chip 32-bit microprocessor. <br> Japan&#39;s Nikkei business daily reported on June 7, 1985, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense to begin developing a new semiconductor material gallium world&#39;s most high-speed 32-bit microprocessor. <br> development system is composed by McDonnell - Douglas Corporation, and Texas Instruments as well as Control Data Corporation. The target is made of nearly 100 times faster than the super small computing speed microprocessor. Gallium chip so small on the fingertips, 10,000 electronic circuits in the chip, the design goals of the operation speed of 100 million instructions per second, then the silicon material commercially available 32-bit microprocessor computing speed of 100 million instructions per second. <br>'
