The \"the Donghua recorded\" records, Dorgon long and out of the palace hospital, Junji Dorgon Wong parent regent, Queen Mother of the early Qing Dynasty Mystery \"marry\" the matter, when the non-groundless. For political reasons, such initiatives detract from her historical status. Due to the mediation of the Queen Mother Xiao Zhuang, Junji throne to keep many Dagon no Instead Qing power Junji gradually shifted to the hands. <br> Han upper support in order to create the early Qing Dynasty, the Empress Dowager Xiao Zhuang dare to break through the full, the Han must not intermarry practice, Junji 10 years (1653), she Kong Youde&#39;s daughter holes Zhen \"Yuzhi palace & rdquo ; deemed the imperial clan Sheriff look; took Huangtaiji the Fourteenth female and Master princess to marry the son of Wu Sangui Wu Yingxiong play a role in win over Han generals.

The the <br> 1687 years Kangxi 20 years, too Empress Dowager passed away at the age of seventy-five, for \"Xiao Zhuang Wenhuang\". is not buried with Taiji Shenyang Zhaoling <br> puzzling, went into the Qing imperial tombs built mausoleum until Emperor Kangxi dead, nor grandmother Xiao Zhuang Wenhuang Zigong temporary Anfeng temple stopped for 38 years, to the end, 1730 2003 (1725) by the great-grandson of Yin? intrauterine buried in the Eastern Qing Tombs of feng shui wall ground. What is the reason for it? Even though so far not found a convincing explanation, is still a mystery, but this folklore many. <br> the Xiaozhuang Queen Why not buried into Zhaoling regarding civil Tuomeng Dingling address \". The effect that: Xiaozhuang Queen&#39;s death, the Qing government in compliance with the progenitor system, decided she buried into the Zhaoling Taizong buried. But when the Zigong via Tanglin sudden heavy abnormal. The 128 bars Cardiff all the weight of Ziya Liezui, stars, and unable to move, had to the Zigong place parked. After a two hour, would like to move on, the Zigong just as long on the ground, did not move. The erupted anxious the funeral procession of the kings Minister, so fly quoted court. Emperor Kangxi (lssdjt.cn) received a memorial, is also unable to do anything. That night the emperor dreamed Xiaozhuang Queen, the emperor said: \"I was determined to not Taizong buried, Zigong park land is Gigajob soil, ready-built mausoleum burial, remember Mark me, Hugh Wei Wu. Emperor woke compliance instructed, pick an auspicious day dove workers, that is built mausoleum. Back again moving coffin is not so heavy. Obviously, this is purely a myth, can not be used as a basis. said <br> there, that because the Xiaozhuang Queen married Dorgon has not Huangtaiji Queen, so she did not qualify demeaning Zhaoling discredited and Huangtaiji buried. Qing court official book never the Xiaozhuang Queen to marry to Dorgon the records, Emperor Kangxi Emperor always admitted that she is the Queen of the Emperor Taizong. So this reason is not sufficient. The (Lssdjt.com) <br> and access to historical data, Xiaozhuang Queen not Huangtaiji buried so written that. Xiaozhuang Queen lifetime thing for their own burial grounds have long left wills. She exhorting the Kangxi Emperor: \"things behind me special Well you: Emperor Taizong text Zigong Anfeng a long time ago, Peel is not moving statue, the inconvenience buried. Do from the grave domain, too sheer dynamic congregation, to study the meaning of non-buried. Heart I love you father and son could not bear to go away, be sure to Zunhua The burial, my heart regrets carry. \"Kangxi Emperor has always been dutiful grandmother, the Xiaozhuang Queen after the death of Emperor Kangxi in accordance with a will, the grandmother buried in near Zunhua the Dongling. then <br>, why Xiaozhuang was buried in a the Qing Tombs dahongmen east side of feng shui wall, rather than imperial tombs within it? many unofficial Xiaozhuang marry Dorgon lost love new feel the Luo family&#39;s face, so she was buried in the hilly area outside the main entrance, and punished her for generations for the descendants of the door. In fact, this is only the hearts softened the subjective sense. The real reason is that in the supreme position of the Mausoleum region, Junji Xiaoling while Xiaozhuang Junji biological mother, she was buried in the mausoleum anywhere in the region, and location are lower than Xiaoling, which not with her generational proportionality. Xiaozhuang was buried in the Eastern Qing Tombs, Zunhua, but far away in Shenyang Huangtaiji Zhaoling is still a system. Xiaozhuang Queen&#39;s Mausoleum Mingjiao Zhao Xiling, and therefore see two different systems with the Eastern Qing Tombs, should not be confused, can only be buried outside the Dongling District, to be identified. Third, in the Qing Dynasty, regardless of the emperor, kings Yeling, start with the highest seniority in the family tomb of the mausoleum. Xiaozhuang Queen&#39;s the Qing Tombs within buried among the highest seniority, when Yeling every time they must first the Xiaozhuang Empress Zhao Xi Ling began. Dahongmen the main entrance of the mausoleum. Is a the Yeling necessary at. Zhaoling built in Dahongmen next, but also provide Yeling great convenience to avoid the pass to and from the labor. Fourth, the Qing Dynasty to the left of the bit of honor the emperor Yeling, and out of the palace gates, the doors of the house, the mausoleum doors are left to the door, minister workers take the right door. Zhaoling built in Dahongmen the left, is valued at, and also reflects the meaning of the respected her admiration of the children and grandchildren of her offspring. High dahongmen the left side of the terrain and flat soil thick pure dahongmen the right side, the low-lying rocky, and bordering the West river often floods, geographical environment from the point of view should be Zhaoxi mausoleum built in the Dahongmen left. From the above points of view, the the Xiaozhuang Queen burial outside the Dongling hill, not punished her for future generations to guard the tomb doors, but considering that the best choice was made to various reasons Xiaozhuang Queen surname Bor Economic gut names cloth wood Buthe, born on 28 March 1613 Sunrise Mongolia Horqin Noble, gold family, descendants of Genghis Khan. 13 years old, married to a, four Baylor Taiji, after the Golden State.
