'title'=>'China in the world on the first synthesis of two new nuclides',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'September 28, 1992 (Renshen September third) in the world, China was first synthesized two new nuclides. Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in the world in September, <br> 1992 first synthesized and identified mercury -208, hafnium -185 two new nuclides, which is the synthesis of new, following the Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences significant achievements in the nuclide germanium after Chinese scientists away from the line of stability on the international nuclear synthesis and study of fierce competition. Not long ago, the General Secretary Jiang Zemin went to the inspection highly appreciates. Scientists various nuclei are collectively referred to as radionuclide. So far, in addition to earth nature, there are more than three hundred kinds radionuclide, mankind has synthesized and identified more than 2100 nuclides, the future is possible to synthesize and identify new radionuclide is estimated that there are more than 600 kinds. The synthesis and study of new nuclei, has and will further enrich and deepen human understanding of the the nucleus internal structure and the laws of motion, test and development of existing nucleus theory, and promote the development of related thereto astrophysics and nuclear chemistry. (Today in History TodayOnHistory.com) Chinese Academy of Sciences, the study of the frontier as the \"Eighth Five major projects, the State Science and Technology Commission, the National Natural Science Fund Committee has given a great concern of this study and supported. After the completion of the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator, Institute of Modern Physics where that legislation the new nuclides synthesis research is one of the major research projects carried out by accelerator began preliminary research from the first half of 1989. New nuclide synthesis, rapid separation, identification is a difficult research subjects is a common challenge faced by scientists around the world to fill the vacancy on the chart of nuclides. Greater than 170 \"mass neutron-rich region,\" especially in the number of nuclear mass, the new nuclides synthesis, separation, identification more difficult. New nuclide synthesis and study of the project team researchers of the Institute of Modern Physics, presented a unique physical quality of heavy neutron-rich region the synthesis of new nuclides ideas and technical route, after two years repeated the experiment, and finally in the synthesis, separation, identification of the new nuclides mercury -208, and successful hafnium -185 scientific research. Experts believe that these two significant results achieved in the near objects, both technically significant breakthrough, but also has the important academic value. New nuclides mercury -208, the hafnium -185 artificial synthesis, in order to test the theoretical model provides an important experimental basis, and shows HIRFL an important role in the synthesis and study of new nuclides. <br>'
