'cont'=>'(““≥Û the twelfth lunar month 19), January 28, 1986, the Challenger spacecraft exploded. the <br> space shuttle Challenger exploded in the air <br> 1986 January 28, 2010, the U.S. space shuttle \"Challenger\" 72 seconds after launch from the Kennedy Space Center in the 15,000 m altitude suddenly exploded, killing all seven crew members on board. Aircraft fried in a split second into a ball of red and white fire fog scattered debris of the aircraft within an hour to the Atlantic ocean nine kilometers away from the launch center. the <br> 1 28, \"Challenger\" has just left the Cape Canaveral launch pad soon, it exploded in a fireball. This is the deadliest accident in the history of the American Astronautical Thousands of Florida viewers and millions of television viewers witnessed the heartbreaking disaster. Francis-R, the martyrs (L $ dj¶”.c®≠m) <br> organic long-Scobee, pilot Michael-J-Smith, astronauts Zhu Dean-A-Resnick, Ronald-E-Mike ng Ellison-S-the oni Zhu card, Gregory-B-Jarvis and Christa - McAuliffe. McAuliffe is a female secondary school teacher from Concord, New Hampshire, is expected to become the universe, an ordinary citizen. Mrs. McAuliffe singled out from the many candidates for the completion of the space mission, her students along with the millions of Americans witnessed on television this unfortunate. <br> the causes of the accident have no clue. National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said that during the investigation period all spaceflight should stop. The launch time of the <br> \"Challenger\" is scheduled for January 25. Postponed due to bad weather, three days. The launch schedule in 9:38, but the unusual low temperature so that the body of the space shuttle and its ground support structure to end up on the ice, it is also postponed two hours. <br> 11:08, \"Challenger\" liftoff, the usual rise by 74 seconds. Subsequently, when the \"Challenger\" from the ground 10 miles of the main engine was about to be pushed to full speed, the space shuttle exploded in a fireball. From the space shuttle&#39;s last words were: \"understand, full speed ahead! \"Scobie said the flight control center. The explosion occurs when two great white clouds, then rain of debris like falling. At first, thousands of tourists, NASA officials, reporters and other spectators, including Christa - McAuliffe&#39;s husband, two children and their parents, no one realized what was happening, but when orange-red fireball in the air falling, stunned ended sound of people cheering for the \"Challenger\".

He denied postponed three days before President State of the Union address to Congress in January of each year (the NASA shuttle launches scheduled in the night of the launch) any pressure. \"Launch the space shuttle does not have any pressure.\" Moore said, \"We have always adhere to the principle of first flight safety ranking aerospace engineering. \"<br> NASA officials do not fully believe that the Cape Canaveral cold may be led to the space shuttle explosion factors speculation. According to the analysis may be loaded with 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 140,000 gallons of liquid oxygen in the external fuel tank rupture or fuel pipe rupture caused this tragedy. Through the telescope under explosive slow-motion video that start small flames at the base of the external fuel tank, followed by two solid-fuel rocket is disconnected, then the fireball engulfed the space shuttle. <br> NASA fleet of Coast Guard vessels after the explosion is still gathering one hour crashed into the wreckage in the oceans. The salvage work is also the scene of the explosion in the range of 18-20 miles of the coast of Florida a few weeks, the government asked residents will find drift aircraft debris turned over to the Florida coast. Did not find the relics of the astronauts. In this year Aerospace busiest in the history of the year, it is expected that the implementation of the 15 space program. \"Challenger\" No. crash, however, the U.S. aerospace engineering at a standstill because the NASA launch systems are not prepared.
