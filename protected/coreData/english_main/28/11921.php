'cont'=>'December 28, 1903 (mao winter in early ten), the the computer father of von Neumann&#39;s Birthday. In In 1903, John von Neumann was born in Budapest, Hungary. He lives in a very wealthy family. Childhood shows talent in science. The age of 10, he entered the High School of Budapest. In the future, he can get a further play. The age of 12, he mastered the theory of functions. Under 18 years of age, (L $ dj而.c身m) the mathematics magazine in Germany, he published a paper. <br> 1921, Neumann learning mathematics into the University of Budapest. Later (history today www.lssdjt.com) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, he was a master&#39;s degree in Chemistry, was the degree of Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Budapest. <br> 1927, Neumann when a lecturer at the University of Hamburg. In 1928, he became a visiting professor at Princeton University in the United States, in 1931, he became a tenured professor in the university. <br> Neumann also mastered Latin and Greek, to be fluent in English, German, French conversation. <br> 1942, the United States set up mainly for making bombs Institute of Los Alamos. 1943, Neumann in an advisory capacity to participate in the work of the Institute of Los Alamos. <br> Los Alamos Institute gave Neumann Many research topics. To solve these problems, Neumann must be carried out a large number of calculations. Due to the requirements of this work, he began to envision the development of high-speed electronic computer. <br> At that time, the most state-of-the-art computer \"ENIAC\". Computer operation from 1946, it has storage capacity, but the operation, to be operated by hand control panel switch. Every change the contents of work, but also a new set of wiring loaded machine, teach machine program Moreover, the machine is also very prone to failure. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> Neumann with Molik, Eckert, developed the storage means and the basic instructions are grouped together, the control instruction of the method incorporated in the storage means. In this way, change the program without changing the wiring. This is the so-called built-in program mode. So, on a discrete variable automatic computer (the EDVAC \"). In this way, computer pregnant with infinite possibilities of universal mechanical mechanical evolution from simple arithmetic. (? V history today?? Com) <br> Neumann still computing theoretically made important contributions to the use of the computer. <br> 1945 the year after, the 42-year-old Neumann became the director of the Institute of Computer Science of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Since then, he and his colleagues developed a computer called \"JONI-aC\". <br> in computer design, they mimic the action of a biological brain. Since then, Neumann began to study neurology. He studied from the point of view of neurology and psychology, thereby establishing automation theory. <br> 1954, Neumann became a member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. February 8, 1957, he died of illness. <br> in the long history of the development of the electronic computer, no single individual can monopolize the inventor of the seats. However, it can be said, Neumann is a development of computer technology has made great contribution to the people. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br>'
