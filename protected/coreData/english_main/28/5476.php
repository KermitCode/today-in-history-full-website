'cont'=>'May 28, 1998, three days of May (Tiger years), the death of the pioneers of nuclear physics research Professor Zhao Zhongyao. May <br> 1998 28, the famous physicist, a pioneer in nuclear physics research in China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Professor Zhao Zhongyao died of illness at the age of 96 years old. Professor Zhao Zhongyao <br> Zhejiang Zhuji County. Physicist and educator. A pioneer and one of the founders of China&#39;s nuclear physics, accelerator, cosmic ray research. Found that the anomalous absorption of hard gamma rays as well as the accompanying special radiation, first observed the phenomenon of electron-positron pair creation and annihilation, the discovery of the positron and physicists to accept the theory of quantum electrodynamics played an important role in . (History cn) In 1925 he graduated from the Southeast University, he served as Tsinghua University teaching assistant, and in 1927 went to the California Institute of Technology study, received his Ph.D. in 1930. Zhao Zhongyao returning home in 1931, he served as Professor of Physics, Tsinghua University, Nuclear Physics course opened for the first time in our country, and presided over the establishment of China&#39;s first nuclear physics laboratory, to continue to carry out scientific research. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Professor Zhao Zhongyao has taught at Yunnan University, Southwest and Central University, has trained a number of future talent to contribute to the cause for China Atomic Energy in the long-term teaching activities. the After the war <br>, Professor Zhao Zhongyao was very necessary for nuclear physics laboratory equipment better established in the country. In 1946, he went to the Bikini Islands to visit the U.S. atomic bomb test, and later at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, California Institute of Technology, etc. for research in nuclear physics and cosmic rays. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> 1950 Zhao Zhongyao all the odds, decided to return to the New China, to participate in the creation of the Institute of Modern Physics. To bring home the accelerator components and laboratory equipment, he has built up in 1955 and 1958, China&#39;s first 700,000-volt proton 2 million-volt high-pressure electrostatic accelerator of nuclear physics, accelerator and vacuum technology, ion source technology research laid the foundation. Electrostatic accelerator, Professor Zhao Zhongyao established under the auspices of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory, specific leadership and to participate in the study of nuclear reactions, and make an important contribution to create the cause of China&#39;s Nuclear Science. In 1972, he was involved in the preparatory work for the establishment of the High Energy Physics Institute, served as deputy director of Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of High Energy Physics, deputy director and other staff. <br> Professor Zhao Zhongyao for the development of nuclear physics and high energy physics research career, to cultivate the China Atomic Energy cause of nuclear physics and high-energy physics and experimental research talent to make a significant contribution of nuclear physics, neutron physics, accelerator and cosmic ray research a pioneer and one of the founders. <br>'
