'cont'=>'May 28, 1907 (April 17) DingWei Chinese physicist Wang Ganchang born in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province. <br> Wang Ganchang Chinese physicist. Born May 28, 1907 in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province. Graduated from Tsinghua University in 1929, by the school in leaves Qisun, Wu Xun. 1929 to 1930, at Tsinghua University assistant. (TodayinHistory.cn) 1930 study in Germany, Rubai Lin University, engaged in L. Meitner, under the guidance of the beta decay spectroscopy study, completed in 1934 \"Th B + C + C\" ¦Â spectroscopy \"(same year PhD thesis on the physical magazine). From 1934 to 1936 Professor of Physics Department of Shandong University. From 1936 to 1950, he was appointed professor of Zhejiang University, Department of Physics and former Head of the Department. Concurrently deputy director from 1950 to 1956, the researcher at the Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1952. From 1956 to 1960, he served as part-time deputy director of the Soviet Dubna Joint Institute of Nuclear Research Fellow, 1958. From 1961 to 1978, he was appointed to the Ministry of Machinery Industry (ie, the nuclear industry) Research Institute, 1978 to 1982 as deputy ministers, he served as director and researcher of the Institute of Atomic Energy, 1982, he was appointed deputy director of the Science and Technology Commission, Atomic Energy Research the honorary director and researcher. Appointed in 1955 as the Academy of Mathematics Physics Chemistry Department (now the Ministry of mathematical physics) Acdemy. Also served as vice chairman of the Association of Science and Technology of the People&#39;s Republic of China, vice chairman of the Chinese Physical Society (now an honorary member), chairman of the China Nuclear Society (now an honorary member). Was elected as the third to the Sixth National People&#39;s Congress Standing Committee members. He is the Jiu San Society Central Committee members. <br> of Wang Ganchang the contribution is mainly in the area of &#8203;&#8203;experimental physics, theoretical physics has deep knowledge. His early years, is committed to the exploration of particle physics. In 1930 he went to Berlin soon, hear the WWG Bot report the ¦Ò particle bombardment of beryllium Nuclear found that a high-energy rays, he proposed that the cloud chamber to study the performance of this ray. This vision is not obtained tutor support and failed to achieve, but more than a year later, J. Chadwick is through this experiment and found that the neutron (see nuclear). Sino-Japanese War broke out, he moved westward with the Zhejiang University, Guizhou Zunyi and Meitan. Under extremely difficult conditions, adhere to the teaching and research, and in 1941 he proposed the release of K-shell electron neutrino recoil detection neutrino capture by light nuclei (such as?? Be). Recoil energy and momentum of the nuclei in this type of process, (such as?? Li) will only be associated with the emission of neutrinos. His own ideas written \"recommendations of the neutrino,\" a paper published in the January 1942 issue of the American Physical Review. This year, the American physicist JS Allen accordingly?? Of Be K-trapping experiments confirmed his predictions. Until 1953 the use of atomic reactors to generate strong anti-neutrino beam directly detected freedom antineutrino ago, this is about the most powerful evidence of neutrinos exist, is considered to be one of the important achievements of the 1942 World Physics. <br> Wang Ganchang another important achievement in particle physics is found that the anti-sigma negative hyperon (see strange particles). This is a team he led at the end of 1959 in the Soviet Dubna Joint Institute of Nuclear Research 10GeV proton synchrophasotron and 24L propane bubble chamber of their own manufacture, from the 40,000 photos. This is first observed in energy-¦Ð meson nuclear reaction antiparticle produce decay and decay products annihilation complete picture. The hyperon major discovery antiparticle further confirmed any particle anti-particle theory predicts that this discovery is the most important results achieved in this accelerator. 1982, the National Natural Science Prize, the highest award of Chinese physicists first domestic. Wang Ganchang After returning to China in <br> 1960, participated in the atomic bomb and participation in leadership, which is a major project in order to break the nuclear monopoly of the big powers. Wang Ganchang with a number of outstanding physicists, as well as other staff, laboratory and testing ground in the northwest plateau and desert through thick and thin, after four years of hard work, and finally in October 16, 1964 explosion of China&#39;s first atomic bombs, and continue efforts at June 17, 1967 explosion of the first hydrogen bomb. Wang Ganchang made such a major contribution, can not be spared from the disaster in the ten years of chaos in 1968 after he was criticized and humiliated, to protest against the \"Gang of Four\" perverse acts, regardless of personal safety, (lssjt.cn ) on the eve of the 1976 Tiananmen incident, in Tiananmen Square offer wreaths of mourning Premier Zhou Enlai, and the Department of the name. This justice, courageous act is to take a big risk at the time. <br> In addition, in 1964, he is independent of the Soviet Union ¦§.¦£. Basov proposed the idea of &#8203;&#8203;laser inertial confinement fusion and organizations experimental research work carried out in this regard. In recent years, engaged in inertial confinement fusion research, and advocating for the construction of nuclear power plants in China. Decades, Wang Ganchang responsible for many of the organizational leadership work, and always adhere to the scientific work of the first line. the <br> Comments: the success of China&#39;s atomic bomb made a significant contribution <br>'
