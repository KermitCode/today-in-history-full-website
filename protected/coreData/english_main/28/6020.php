'cont'=>'June 28, 2009 (Year of the OX Run May sixth days), the world&#39;s first ultra-deepwater offshore drilling oil platform construction success. The world&#39;s first cylindrical <br> <br> Xinhua Nanjing June 28 Xinhua (Reporter Cai Yongjun) ultra-deepwater offshore drilling oil storage platform built on the 28th at the COSCO Shipyard Group COSCO Nantong Shipyard Co., Ltd. belongs to is named \"SEVAN DRILLER\" (plug wang drilling). [L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À] <br> \"SEVAN DRILLER\" is the sixth-generation semi-submersible platform built by Nantong COSCO Shipyard Norwegian SEVAN MARINE (plug prosperous maritime), cost 600 million U.S. dollars. Nantong COSCO Shipyard involved in research and development and the basic design of the project, and to undertake the detailed design, production design, the overall construction and installation and commissioning of all equipment have reached the level of the world &#39;s leading technology and construction, has been the owner, (lsjt net) Det Norske Veritas and end users Petrobras recognized. <br> \"SEVAN DRILLER\" the ocean drilling oil platform belonging to the highest level of technology in today&#39;s world of offshore oil drilling platform, operational capabilities most high-end leading product. The design depth of 12,500 ft drilling depth of 40,000 feet, eight propeller positioning and configuration of the world&#39;s most advanced DP-3 dynamic positioning system and mooring system can adapt to adverse sea conditions of minus 20 degrees in the UK North Sea. The variable platform deck load of 15,000 tons, has a storage capacity of 15 million barrels of crude oil. This platform total height of 135 meters, 84 meters in diameter, 24.5 meters in height of the main deck, lightship weight of 28,180 tons, the living floor, can accommodate 150 people live. According to reports <br> SEVAN DRILLER function is very powerful, extremely complex equipment, which only cable rope laying of 620 km, automatic control more than 14,000 alarm points, internal installation of various special drilling equipment 930 sets, these data are the highest domestic first or even the world&#39;s first, and the design and the main construction period of only 24 months, six months ahead of the construction cycle than similar products. In the same time, this project is the first of the domestic marine engineering with 100% margin construction, to fill the domestic marine engineering steel structure blank margin construction. the <br> general manager of COSCO Shipyard said Wang as hand marine engineering products, a total of $ 1.2 billion, the output value accounted for one-third of the market share of domestic marine engineering, product range covering from coastal waters to the deep ocean all types, to become one of the early start, master of all kinds of marine engineering one of the few shipyards. <br> <br> Review: China has created a miracle, congratulations shipwright.
