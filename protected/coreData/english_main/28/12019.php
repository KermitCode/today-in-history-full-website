'cont'=>'December 28, 1882 (the Horse the winter on 19), the British astrophysicist and mathematician Eddington was born. the <br> British astrophysicist and mathematician Eddington <br> 1882 12 28, the British astrophysicist, mathematician Eddington born in Kendal, England. <br> 1902, Eddington graduated from Owens College (now the University of Manchester), graduated from Cambridge University in 1905. From 1906 to 1913, he served as the Greenwich Royal Observatory, the chief assistant, and after that, when returned to Cambridge on astronomy Pulu Mu Chair Professor. <br> Eddington earliest work is the study of stellar motions, and after this, he began to study the internal structure of the stars and from 1916, the findings were published in his first re-commissioned works, \"the internal structure of the stars \". He introduced one kind previously overlooked phenomenon, you can pass the enormous impact of the radiation pressure on the balance of the stars, as heat from the planet internal to external propagation, not as the original people envisaged by convection, but by radiation. <br> It is in this research work, Eddington comprehensively summed up the quality. The relationship between the luminance. This relationship was found in 1924. It noted that the larger the mass of an astral have, the more the light will be able to issue. The value of this conclusion is that, if the intrinsic brightness of a star known, can be sure that it is the quality of this brightness. Eddington also recognize that the volume of the star has a limit: the quality can be more than 10 times the solar mass stars, their number is relatively small the stars 50 times more than the sun, and any quality, due to excessive radiation pressure it is impossible to be stable. <br> Eddington wrote a large number of scientific monographs and popular books. Some of his writings are quite popular, including the expansion of the universe \"reprinted. It is because of the introduction of Eddington, patriotic Stan&#39;s general theory of relativity was spread to English-speaking countries. Eddington deeply influenced by relativistic theory and experimental evidence. He observed that the 1919 full-candle and submit a report, the report said, surprising predictions made by Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity in an extremely precise successfully observed, this is the light by the stellar (ie, sun ) the gravitational field generated slightly bent. In 1924, Einstein&#39;s theory has been further support: Eddington&#39;s request, Walter - Adams to detect and measure the offset of the high density of white dwarf companion of Sirius Sirius wavelength, thus confirming Einstein &#39;s prophecy - stellar light turns red due to the role of the gravitational field. So, Eddington made a lot of work to Einstein&#39;s theory of building strictly solid foundation. In his mathematical principles of the theory of relativity, Eddington also extremely brilliantly expounded this theory. The between (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> years, Eddington countersunk delve into an esoteric obscure but challenging theory, the theory behind him before being published in the posthumous basic theory. Generally speaking, Eddington thought: basic scientific constants, such as the quality of the proton, the electron mass and charge load, \"the structure of the universe, the natural and completely Provisions, their value is not accidental &#39;s. Eddington was committed to the development of the theory can the value introduced to. But failed. <br>'
