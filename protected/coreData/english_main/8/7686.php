'cont'=>'August 8, 1999 (June 27) JiMao the first time that China has independently developed the \"practice of the fifth satellite successfully completed the task. <br> 1999, equipped with our independently developed the common platform for small satellite \"Practice V, since May 10, 1999 launch, the normal operation of 90 days, the successful completion of the task, get large amounts of data, as well as many of the results. <br> launch small satellites since the 1980s, the development trend of the international satellite. According to the briefing, design, developed by the China Academy of Space Technology \"Practice V\" and weighs 300 kg, volume of 1.2 cubic meters, running on a sun-synchronous orbit 870 kilometers above the ground. \"Practice V\" public platform for the first time equipped with our own developed CAST968. This platform satellite into space on the ground of scientific laboratory instruments and equipment to provide effective services. This satellite developed by China into the international satellite modular, miniaturized, integrated the ranks of the underlying trends. China spent only two years, on the completion of the design and development of the \"practice of the 5th. <br> data \"Practice V users of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\" Practice V \"the main task of the small satellite: space single-particle measurements and Countermeasures Research and space charged particle environment and dose measurements ; in-orbit test spacecraft S-band high-speed data-transmission transmitter and large capacity solid state memory; fluid science experiments. <br>, the use of the materials can not be produced by the space environment, production ground to bring the dawn of the new human material production. Float-zone growth of crystalline materials is the most promising space material preparation methods. \"Practice V space microgravity fluid science experiments for the first time observed a large number of unknown phenomena under low-gravity conditions. This is China&#39;s first microgravity fluid science experiment is the first satellite in the world to implement such a complex experiment. It is understood that, \"the practice of Five\" in the main task is completed, will continue to remain rail, and other scientific experiments. <br>'
