'title'=>'China developed a high-power helium-neon laser',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'June 8, 1995 (May 11), seeing in China developed a high-power helium-neon laser. <br> an output power of up to 350 mW helium-neon laser in Beijing on June 5, 1995 by experts. The appraisal committee chaired by Wang Daheng academicians After careful deliberations: the laser output power level of a world leader. <br> helium-neon laser is a common gas lasers, glows bright red laser, but generally lower output power, both in the number of 10 mW, this new type of high-power helium-neon laser to change the traditional design method, using an ingenious novel structure, greatly improving the output power per unit length of the laser tube, in order to achieve a short cavity high power output. Ling Yiming Professor <br> Southeast University, invented and led the development of this laser is funded projects of the National Natural Science Foundation Committee. Decade of sword, from the initial idea into a prototype of today, a lot of effort devoted researchers. This laser technology has been the Chinese invention patents and U.S. patent, which is the invention of the laser was patent in the United States for the first time in the field. <br> such high-power He-Ne laser application prospects of the development of laser technology and its applications, in particular, is of great significance for the development of laser medical photodynamic cancer therapy light source. In addition, it can also be used for the irradiation treatments, laser dust detection. [Today in History www.TodayOnHistory.com] <br>'
