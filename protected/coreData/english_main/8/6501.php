'cont'=>'(June 15), Kang Xi, July 8, 1979, Japanese physicist Tomonaga Shinichiro&#39;s death. <br> <br> Tomonaga Shinichiro (1906-1979), Japanese theoretical physicist (L $ dj而.c身m) winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics. <br> Tomonaga Shinichiro, born on March 31, 1906 in Tokyo, Japan. 1929 graduated from Kyoto University, Faculty of Science, physical sciences. The subsequent provisional Trainee Graduate the Jade City Jia Qilang Laboratory. After three years, went to the Tokyo Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, researcher when Nishina Yoshio Laboratory. To study in Germany in 1937, WK Heisenberg&#39;s leading research in nuclear theory and quantum theory. The end of 1939, returning to Tokyo Imperial University Doctorate of Science. In 1941, he was a professor of physics at the University of Tokyo arts and sciences proposed quantum field theory, super long time theory. During World War II, have studied the theory magnetron radar technology, published a \"split anode the magnetoelectric management &#39;papers. After the war continued research and development of his super long time theory and meson coupling theory, and also participates in the work of the founder of the \"Progress in Theoretical Physics. Tomonaga Shinichiro based on his super long time theory, find the divergence of quantum electrodynamics is a way around difficult way, this is the famous renormalization. Using this method, can be successfully interpreted lamb shift and electronic anomalous magnetic moment of the experiment. Almost at the same time, the American physicist JS Schwinger, RP fee Feynman also independently completed a similar study. The study of the roads lead to Rome to be an accurate theory makes the description of the microscopic world of quantum electrodynamics theory and future theoretical developments have had a profound impact. 1949, (1 $ dj而.c身m) Tomonaga Shinichiro candidates to the United States Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton work, the high density limit of the one-dimensional model of multi-fermion system theory. After returning to create the Institute for Nuclear Research of the University of Tokyo. Since 1956, has served as president of Tokyo University of Education, president of the Science Council of Japan, Tokyo University of Education, optical, director of the Institute. July 8, 1979 and passed away in Tokyo. the <br> 1965 years, Tomonaga Shinichiro achievements in quantum electrodynamics basic theoretical research, Schwinger, Feynman shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. He also received a Bachelor Academy in Japan, the title of Honorary Fellow of Japan&#39;s Order of Culture, as well as several national academies of science. In 1957, in May Tomonaga Shinichiro, who led the Japan Physical delegation to China visit and conduct academic exchanges. Sanjuro the <br> Tomonaga Shinichiro father of Western philosophy researcher Tomonaga, Sanjuro Tomonaga Nishida Kitaro is Kyoto School a; Tomonaga Shinichiro born in Kyoto, third colleges and universities after graduation, to enter the Kyoto Imperial University Department of Physics schools and graduation; Tomonaga Shinichiro went to Princeton University in the United States after World War II, research. <br> towards Wing Shinichiro research as renormalization (Renormalization) theory and neutron research, and because the renormalization theory won the Nobel Prize in Physics. And Tomonaga Shinichiro writing to many popular writings on science. <br> famous Japanese physicist, who have made outstanding contributions to the development of physical theory obtained great achievements. <br>'
