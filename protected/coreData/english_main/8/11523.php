'cont'=>'December 8, 1989 (of Baba the winter months k), the Beijing Electron Positron Collider synchrotron radiation facility through the identification. <br> Beijing Electron Positron Collider National Laboratory location <br> 1989 December 8, 2010, the Beijing Electron Positron Collider Synchrotron Radiation Facility through the national identification. composed of 29 experts <br> appraisal committee believes that the Beijing Electron Positron Collider Synchrotron Radiation Facility began operation provides good conditions for natural science research, technology development and industrial applications, and is bound to promote the interpenetration of disciplines and to bring huge boost to the development of many other disciplines in the field. <br> According to reports, the Beijing Electron Positron Collider storage ring use either mode of high energy physics experiments with synchrotron radiation and synchrotron radiation dedicated mode. In storage ring peripheral Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The first phase of the project completed three front and three beamlines. Experts in the beam line, using a focused X-ray and VUV laser crystal materials, X-ray excitation luminescence experiments, some at home and abroad have not yet been observed, valuable new phenomenon. Using synchrotron radiation light source provides high-brightness X-ray, tens of seconds to complete the X-ray excitation fluorescence spectroscopy of single hair silk to foreign laboratories can achieve the highest level. <br> this device running, will provide much of the hard X-ray spectral range from the vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation for biological physics, biochemistry, photochemistry, solid state physics, atomic and molecular physics, surface physics , materials science, measurement standards and medical research applications. <br>'
