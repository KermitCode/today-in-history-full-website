(history today. com) <br> Dirac was born in Bristol in southwest England, after obtaining a degree in electronic engineering and mathematics at the University of Bristol, for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge in 1926. < ; br> <br> his main contribution to physics: quantum mechanics equations given in the description of the relativistic Fermi particles (Dirac equation), given the anti-particle solution; the magnetic monopoles Prophet; Fermi - Di the Mubarak statistics. Moreover, in quantum field theory, especially quantum electrodynamics also made a groundbreaking work. outstanding work in the theory of gravity and gravitational quantization (lssdjt.cn) <br> his life many writings. \"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\", has been the authority of the classics in the field, and even that was known as the \"Bible\" of quantum mechanics. <br> Dirac (1902-1984) was a British physicist. August 8, 1902 was born in Bristol, England. <br> Dirac in vocational schools, middle school, and after graduating in 1918, was admitted to the University of Bristol Department of Electrical Engineering. 1921 University graduate, received a bachelor&#39;s degree in electrical engineering. When the math graduate student was admitted to St. John&#39;s College at Cambridge University in 1923. Began to study the creation of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg and others in 1925, entitled \"quantum mechanics\" of papers published in 1926, a doctorate in physics in the University of Cambridge, was invited to any researcher at the St. John&#39;s College. 1929 touring the world for an academic visit, the first five-month stay in the United States, and later with Heisenberg&#39;s visit to Japan, and then the Trans-Siberian, returned to England.
