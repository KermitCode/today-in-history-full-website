'cont'=>'October 8, 1998 (August 18), Tiger years, Hubble discovered the most distant galaxy so far. <br> 1998, Hubble discovered the most distant galaxy so far. <br> astronomers said today that the Hubble Space Telescope toward space and time looked farther than previously found that may have existed 13 billion years of the galaxy. <br> these galaxies may be formed in the universe just after the birth. These galaxies are very far away from Earth, their light takes 13 billion years to reach the Space Telescope orbits the Earth. <br> led the research work of the University of Arizona, Roger Thompson said at a press conference: \"These images are the most distant galaxy images ever obtained. Alan Dressler, Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, <br> California, added: \"This is the first time we see the very distant universe, we may see the galaxy formation early stage. However, these objects are very vague, their nature may only with future senior Telescope to explore. \"<br> Thompson believes that looks only the farthest galaxies inevitable spot size is the oldest galaxies in the universe. He said: \"We have found a new object facts mean, we do have to reach the edge of the. \"<br> Southern sky photo of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), 3 Hubble&#39;s wide-angle camera can capture infrared shooting. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> the leftmost image only capture the visible light camera shooting, the far right for the infrared-sensitive camera shooting. The figure can capture the wavelength increases gradually appear black specks far as we know, one of the most distant galaxies. <br> According to the \"Daily Mail\" reported on the 17th, the new repair the Hubble telescope&#39;s high-resolution photos the scientists found that by far the most distant galaxies. Hubble Telescope in May this year, the new wide-angle camera installed on the 3rd shot <br> this by far the most clear photos, the camera can capture longer than the wavelength of visible light, infrared. Oxford University, a group of galaxies can not be photographed in the series before the new photo comparison with 2004 photos found. <br> newly discovered galaxies 13 billion light-years away from us, the picture on the light from 700 million at the age of the universe, \"childhood\". When the universe was only over the life the 5% thereafter take another 80 million years before the formation of our sun and Earth. (Lssdjt.cn) (Celine) <br>'
