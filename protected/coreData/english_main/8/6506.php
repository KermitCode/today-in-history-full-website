'cont'=>'(Landmarks in June, the fourth day), July 8, 1997, scientists have discovered new evidence of life on Mars. Mars Pathfinder spacecraft <br> United States sent back the latest photos, devastating floods have occurred in several billion years ago, Mars Ares plains in the spaceship landing. clear water marks left on <br> from these photos can clearly see due to powerful torrent of shock and piled up pebbles and rocks. The flood in the end is to be further analyzed when it happened, according to participate in \"Mars Pathfinder\" project scientist Michael Malin estimated that the floods may 3000000000-1000000000 years ago. \"Mars Pathfinder\" The photos sent back floods have occurred in the most powerful evidence to date regarding Mars. <br> Marin flooded area equivalent to the area of &#8203;&#8203;the Mediterranean, hundreds of kilometers wide, flood flow of up to 1 million cubic meters per second. Water marks on the rock salts and sediment torrent. the significance of the newly discovered <br> \"Mars Pathfinder\" is that of liquid water once existed on Mars means that Mars may have had life. Martian surface current humidity is low, daytime maximum temperatures of minus 12 degrees Celsius, down to minus 76 degrees Celsius at night. To this end, another scientist involved in the project, Matthew - Grom Baker noted that \"Mars Pathfinder\" found to have been proposed such an inter-title: the ancient period of Mars is warmer wetter? Some scientists also said that single torrent existence can not have life on Mars, and the key is to find evidence of still water once existed on Mars. the <br> United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists said they were confident to find such evidence. Within a few weeks of this year, the flood of photos of Mars sent back they will \"Mars Pathfinder\" for further analysis. <br> scientists believe once existed on Mars life is a big problem, only to study the surface of Mars landscape can not answer this question, collect Martian rock samples, and laboratories on Earth to be analyzed for the job, the work to 2005. <br>'
