'cont'=>'October 8, 1957 (Ding-year of leap August 15), China&#39;s first built Yumen oil fields of natural petroleum base. <br> our country is one of the world&#39;s first discovery and use of oil. As far away as 1700 years ago, the oil had been our working people, used for heating, lighting. Was known as the \"stone paint. The West Jin Zhanghua \"Natural History\" contains: (Yumen) County South rocks out springs ... water, such as fertilizer such as boiled pork JI, Yang Yang Yong Yong, such as condensate cream, fuel Ming, not food, that the tar County. \"This is the oil of the earliest written records. century <br> 11, China&#39;s drilling technology has been fairly level. 1521, has been able to produce oil deep wells drilled. The United States until 1859 before drilling a shallow a depth of 21.7 m. Claiming to drill the Soviet Union, the world&#39;s first one wells drilled in 1848. Oil production history of the Soviet Union and the United States, than our 300 years late. According to the British Needham book about the history of science and technology \", the ancient deep well drilling digging machinery technology is around the 11th century to the West. Until 1900, all wells in the world, basically using the approach created by the Chinese people labeled. <br> However, a long time in a feudal society, the development of social productive forces is extremely slow, and the development of the oil industry is stagnating. Older people remember the past, China has been wearing the hat of the oil-poor countries are kerosene. Although the late nineteenth century, the Yumen oil fields began to be valued by the Chinese and foreign geologists, but until 1939, overcome difficulties, began drilling oil producing tons of crude oil were Nissan. Yumen oil fields built \"target =\" _blank \"> Yumen oil fields become old China into the development of the largest, the most productive oil fields, is also the world&#39;s developed one of the earliest of continental oilfield but this with our vast land and many compared to the population, as a drop in the bucket, does not help our country still did not take off the \"oil-poor country\" hat. <br> After the founding of New China, the country&#39;s oil industry is the rapid development of the October 8, 1957, China a natural oil base - built Yumen oil fields from China has embarked on the construction of large-scale petroleum and mining roads. workers to carry forward the hard work of the majority of the oil front, spirit of Zhantiandoudi revolution, after decades of hard work efforts, \"oil-poor country\" hat thrown into the Pacific. now, our oil will not only be able to self-sufficiency, but also exported to foreign countries. Yumen oil fields have been built into has a geological exploration, drilling, production, oil refining, machinery repair, oilfield construction and oil scientific research departments of large oil conglomerate. <br>'
