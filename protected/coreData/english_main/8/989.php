'cont'=>'February 8, 1725 (on Jiachen In the twelfth lunar month 26), the Russian Tsar Peter the Great (Peter I) died. <br> Peter I Alexeyevich Romanov (May 30, 1672 - 1725, February 8), Czar of Russia (1682 - 1725) <br> ; \"Give me 20 years, but also a miraculous Russia. I am not angry! Never angry! Waters of Russia most needs. - The Peter I <br> perhaps expansion land is the nature of the Tsarist Russia, but the expansion of Russia. Momentum significantly into the doldrums after Ivan the Terrible, keep on the defensive in a hundred years time, seize the Baltic and Black Sea The long-cherished wish of the sea is always a pleasant dream. (Lssjt.cn) this state is maintained until the emergence of Peter the Great. The (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> <br> Peter burly, energetic, violent character, in stark contrast with his predecessors of the Romanov family sick. In 1682, Peter&#39;s half-brother Fedor III died. In the its sister Sofia and MiG-Slavic family, Naryshkin family tripartite fierce contest, 10-year-old Peter and his suffering from scurvy can not be the director&#39;s brother Ivan V became Tsar Peter was just the second Czar real power manipulation in the hands of Sofia Princess. a wide range of interests <br> Peter, and curious childhood has been displayed. In many of his childhood hobby, the two pairs have important implications for the future, one is strong interest in sailing and shipbuilding, which enabled him to develop a national policy development to the ocean, and the establishment of a powerful navy, and the other is play the military game, and his two teenagers game Corps, he later evolved into the most effective two-Sentinel. 1689, Peter took advantage of two legions crushed the conspiracy of his sister Sofia attempts to dethrone him, and Sofia off into the convent, in fact seized power. Ivan V died in 1696, Peter became the sole tsar. <br> 1697, he made an incredible move. Under of Shibi De Mikhailov identity, along with a huge delegation of 250 people to visit the countries of Western Europe, in the meantime, he and even his apprentice shipyard in the Netherlands to learn shipbuilding. In fact this access enormous impact on the future of Russia, advanced technology and systems in the face of the West, Peter hazy idea to change the Russian hearts become so clear and strong. After returning home, a great change in the Russian land of set off bursts of wind and waves. <br> when several ministers to greet the long-haul return of Peter the Great, Peter suddenly picked up in the hands of scissors to cut toward their beard, which opened the prelude to a series of reforms. These reforms were mainly implemented in the context of the Northern War with Sweden. On the military side, Peter compulsory military service, the introduction of the foreign new weapons and strategic technology, but also the establishment of a powerful navy. On the economic front, Peter strongly encouraged the development of industry and commerce, allows business owners to buy the entire village of serfs to factory work, approval of foreigners setting up factories in Russia. The political purpose of the reform is to establish a complete centralized rule, enhance work efficiency. Deprived of the the noble lords Duma meeting functions and replace them with political participation hospital, consists of 11 committees (actually equivalent to the Western countries, \"the Ministry\") is responsible for the specific work; deposed patriarch, replaced religion hospital, so Church to become a part of the state power; divided into administrative regions, the country is divided into 50 provinces. Peter also enacted a \"function table is divided into 14 different grades of the civil and military officials, the the all officials regardless door first born, should start from the lowest level, relying on the merit promotion. <br> cultural, Peter vigorously the introduction of Western books and lifestyle, ordered all his subjects shall wear traditional robes and stay bearded; provisions aristocracy to a certain age must attend school, shall not inherit the title, and selected international students go to Western Europe learning. He also simplified the Russian alphabet, the introduction of the Western calendar, established Russia&#39;s first libraries, hospitals, theaters, museums, printing, also published the first newspaper chief editor personally. field of <br> Peter the reform is so extensive, the breadth of it, more than almost any reform in the history of the world civilization, he criticized the means to take in this process is extremely rude, & ldquo ; resort to brutal means to deal with the barbarous. \" His son Alexei support of the old school aristocracy up against him, fled abroad after returning to Russia promised forgiveness results were tortured in prison, and died in prison. <br> But the assertions Peter reform Russia to become the world&#39;s advanced countries, it is too early. Russian society&#39;s ills - backward serfdom intact in this reform. The reform the purposes <br> Peter is one of Fuguoqiangbing to winning with Sweden Northern War. As early as in Western Europe During the inspection, Peter to form an anti-Swedish alliance with Denmark, Saxony. 1700 the three countries jointly declared war on Sweden. Beginning war adversely Sweden Denmark with lightning speed to force the first exit, and then defeated the Russian military in Narva. Peter the Great impossible to throw in the towel, after the reform and enhance the strength, he regrouped and has 1708 Antilles Nayar campaign and the Battle of Poltava in 1709 to defeat Sweden warlike King Karl XII, especially porta tile war, Peter at the front, to give Swiss Army to devastating. In 1721, Russia and Switzerland, \"Ni Sita was the Treaty signed, the Russians won the coveted Baltic east coast of the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga, large tracts of land, to the sea. Peter the Great Wei Mingda to the vertex. <br> Peter I also won the 1722-1723 invasion of Persia Li Haixi, South Bank land. But his war on Turkey without success, the time, the big country (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) Ottoman Turkish wind Fanyou memory to win the Black Sea to the sea task can only be left to Peter&#39;s successor to complete. <br> 1703, Peter Neva coastal areas to establish a new city - St. Petersburg, then in 1712 moved the capital here.

His life is so rich, as well as a 52-year career seems to have overdraft all his strength. In 1724, he was at the beach rescue several soldiers in distress when cold sick, and the second died in early. He left a strong and vibrant empire. <br> since the era of Ivan III, Russia had already become an important force in Eastern Europe, Russia is a vast rear area to make it more than any other country can withstand combat, but that does not mean that Russia will be able to develop into the world sexual power. In fact, Peter I era, Russia&#39;s strength can only fairly with Sweden or Poland, but weaker than Turkey. After the reforms of Peter the Great, Russia&#39;s emergence as a world power has been so uncertain prospects. Peter I of Russia (lssjt.cn) <br> is comprehensive, including all fields of the system, economic, cultural, military, and to transform Russia into a new stage of development. In this sense, Peter I the impact is greater than Elizabeth I, Louis XIV, emperors, and with the Emperor Meiji (history today www.lssdjt.com) William I (Kaiser), a groundbreaking, change impact emperor, Peter the Great&#39;s personal role is more obvious. Peter I in the list of the regional impact of emperors, only came after the first Qin emperor, mainly on account of Qin Shi Huang&#39;s impact on various aspects of China in 2000, accumulated over the years. (On com) <br> Comment: distinctive features compared with the large number of reformers in the history of Peter the Great&#39;s reforms: reform initiative threat yet to really come with clear learning targets and goals the reform, reform as a source of strength to hold discretionary supreme ruler. These points perhaps Peter the reform to get outstanding results. After 30 years, Peter I left the people is indeed a miracle in Russia. <br>'
