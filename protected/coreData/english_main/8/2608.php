'cont'=>'March 8, 1976 (, hare on February eighth day), Jilin area landed the world&#39;s rare meteorite shower. <br> 1976 afternoon, universe a meteorite shun the Earth revolves around the sun, the direction, a dozen kilometers per second speed crashed into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Because the Fengyun meteorite densely atmospheric the dramatic friction and fly over to the Jilin area, burning, luminous, become a big fireball at 15:01:59 on the 8th explosion in Jilin City suburb Jinzhu commune over. After the explosion of the meteorite, radial to the four winds. The lot of Suixiao meteorite scattered in the Jilin City suburb Datun commune Lijia brigade and Yongji County Jiang dense along the peak commune; little chunks of Telok in Jinzhu commune, nine Southland Brigade vicinity; maximum of three meteorites along the original The flight direction continued westward southerly direction and flew successively fall Jilin City suburb the the nine stations commune Santaizi brigade, the lone sub shop commune wasteland brigade and Yongji County Huapichang commune patron brigade. Last one fell to the ground in 15:02:36, perforation of 1.7 m thick permafrost layer, into a 6.5 meters deep underground, resulting in a depth of 3 meters on the ground, two meters in diameter and Tai Hang, the time the earthquake from the soil waves of up to tens of meters, the clods splash meters away. Has collected the meteorite analysis, based on the current range of about 500 square kilometers this meteorite rain scattered during the seven communes in Jilin City suburbs, Yongji County, Jiaohe County, a population of more than 10 million, did not cause any casualties or losses. Immediately after the landing of the meteorite rain, the local people to the authorities to do the report. Chinese Academy of Sciences, quickly formed a joint investigation team to the scene, the assistance of the provincial and municipal science and technology sector, a series of scientific investigation. So far there are more than 100 pieces, have been collected meteorites. Minimum weight less than 0.5 kg, three each weighing more than 100 kg. The maximum weight of a 1770 kg (history www.lssdjt.com) greatly exceeds the U.S. collection, currently the world&#39;s largest stone meteorites weight (1078 kg). This meteorite shower, regardless of the number, weight and scattered range are rare in the world. Have a very important value for the study of astronomy, astrophysics, high-energy physics, the chemistry of the universe, celestial history, history of the earth. <br> According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a joint investigation team preliminary analysis identified this landing meteorite, varied shapes, rectangular, hexahedral, pyramidal. The meteorite surface has a black, dark brown fusion crust and different sizes of gas India. The meteorite contained mineral pyroxene, olivine, a small amount of metallic minerals kamacite, taenite, magnetite, typical chondrules structure, it is named \"olivine - bronze pyroxene chondrite. \" The chemical elements contained in these meteorites analysis Determination: silicon, magnesium, iron, sulfur, calcium, nickel, aluminum or the like. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> What is a meteorite? <br> meteorite, is the objective existence of a celestial space. As early as 3000 years ago, our country had recorded on meteors and meteorites and very early on the meteorite correct scientific insights. Historical Records day official book, said: \"The stars fall to the ground, the stone also. \"<br> Solar system has nine planets, thousands of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. , Near Earth space, many of the interstellar matter, small like dust, big as a mountain. These objects, in accordance with a certain speed and a track running. Interstellar matter or special track of individual asteroids near the Earth, sometimes enters the atmosphere, and the dramatic impact of the atmospheric friction, heat, burning, luminous, this is what we see meteor. [Lsjt.org] <br> most meteors an altitude of less than 120 kilometers from the ground begins to burn, small \"dust\" in the ashes of dozens of kilometers away from the ground. A few bulky due to the impact of air resistance, the speed getting slower and slower fall, that this meteor stub fell to the ground, meteorites, or called a meteorite. An annual fall of meteorites on Earth are many, but most are small, but most fall into the ocean and inaccessible to hard to find. Sometimes, the meteorite first exploded at high altitude, and then fall down like a burst of \"Stone Rain\" as this is more rare meteorite shower phenomenon. <br> meteorite surface generally have a dark brown hard shell, which is melted at high temperatures, and when the speed is reduced gradually cooled formed. Meteorite surface to another feature, there are many pits like a clamshell shape, which traces its friction with the air combustion, scientific terminology called gas printed. People can judge according to the shape of the dent out the meteorite which direction flight. Meteorite contained ingredients, can be divided into three categories, namely: iron meteorites, stony-iron meteorites and stony meteorites. Meteorite chemical analysis showed that constituent meteorites various chemical elements, are known on earth, that is composed of the same elements of the other bodies of the solar system. <br> meteorite important value in modern scientific research. This precious sample of the universe not only brought us a lot of information space, and will also provide a rare intelligence for a range of scientific fields. <br> the founding of New China, to this date have been found and collected three times a meteorite shower. The first time was found in the fall of China&#39;s Ming Dynasty iron meteorite shower in 1958 eight years in Nandan County, Guangxi; the second stone meteorite rain fell on the territory of dual Zhongyang County in Jilin Province in 1971; (? V history today?? com) This is rare in the history of the world, a stone meteorite shower. <br>'
