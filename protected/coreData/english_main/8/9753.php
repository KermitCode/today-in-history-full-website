Blacks accounted for the vast majority of the South African population for the first time in history, will have the right to vote and stand for election, this result did not come easily, which is the majority of blacks in South Africa come after hundreds of years of hard struggle before political rights. [Lssjt.cn] <br> over half a century, the white minority regime in South Africa developed hundreds of legal racial domination, brutal repression and persecution of blacks. No political rights for blacks as slaves rushed barren \"reservations\" in life; let alone studying in a school with whites, can not be the same even take a bus, suffered humiliation and discrimination. This tragedy will never be repeated in South Africa. <br> now, according to the principles developed by the Multi-Party Negotiating Committee, South Africa&#39;s draft interim constitution has been drawn up.

The same time, the between blacks organization, due to tribal conflicts, does not rule would continue violent incidents. <br> However, the transformation of South Africa, the process towards democracy is irreversible, the old and then return to apartheid unworkable. As Nelson Mandela said: \"We must completely rebuild our country,\" We have succeeded in building a country of all South African brothers and sisters to each other, sharing weal and woe, to exclude from the point of view of race and ethnicity to explain their identity such a terrible thing. \"<br> People believe that the return to the international family of South Africa, regardless of ethnic joint, united together, to take advantage of the rich resources, will create a democratic, prosperous new South Africa. <br>'
