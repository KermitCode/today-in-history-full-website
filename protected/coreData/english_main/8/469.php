'cont'=>'January 8, 2011, the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month (GY), found that a large area in the South China Sea \"combustible ice\" reserves of about 19.4 billion cubic meters. <br> \"attention to watch a performance below! we will show you an incredible ice. \"With the operation of the instructors, a seemingly ordinary white ice,\" puff \"sound, kindled the flame - which occurred at the scene of Pacific International Exposition in Aichi, Japan, so the presence of the audience amazed. <br> this ice is known as \"combustible ice\" gas hydrates, appearance mimicking snow ignition to burn. <br> 2011, completed by the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey Bureau Shenhu area of &#8203;&#8203;the northern part of the South China Sea gas hydrate drilling results Report Final Appeal, \"the report clearly pointed out that the expedition in the South China Sea in northern Shenhu waters drilling target areas delineated 11 combustible ice ore body reserves of about 19.4 billion cubic meters, showing good gas resource potential. South China Sea exploration of combustible ice exposed the tip of the iceberg \". <br> countries have high expectations for the development and utilization of combustible ice. In 2002, Japan, Canada, the United States, Germany, India launched a joint research activities, transport to the surface from underground combustible ice methane gas in Canada first. In 2006, the research team of the University of Tokyo and marine research and development institutions in Japan new?? The county discovered near East Asia, first exposed seabed combustible ice. The reserves approximately 19.4 billion m3 <br> reporters learned from the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey Bureau, May 2007, organized by the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey Bureau, commissioned Fugro International Group Company Bavenit number drillship assume China&#39;s first natural gas hydrate drilling voyage, Shenhu area in the northern part of the South China Sea, which lasted 52 days, complete the pilot hole drilling 8 core hole drilling five three boreholes in which discovery and obtain a physical samples of gas hydrate, China&#39;s natural gas hydrate exploration major breakthrough. Is known as \"as much as offshore Daqing\". drilling site results and the indoor sample analysis and geophysical treatment outcomes data <br> within the next two years, the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey Bureau, to carry out the gas hydrate mineralization geological conditions and accumulation characteristics, calculated drilling of gas hydrate resources, submitted a report on the outcome. Report Shenhu area in China gas hydrate diffusion enrichment in the lower part of the stability zone above the BSR. Researchers in 140 square kilometers of drilling target areas delineated 11 combustible ice orebody., Including mine the total area of &#8203;&#8203;about 22 square kilometers, seam average effective thickness of approximately 20 m, with estimated reserves of about 19.4 billion cubic meters. This data is an exciting expedition staff drilling area hydrate rich layer of gas is mainly methane, the average content of 98.1%, mainly microbial origin gas hydrate samples containing gas composition and isotope analysis . <br> the link <br> combustible ice: also known as gas hydrate is methane and water in the seabed under the high pressure and low temperature the formation of a white solid fuel, and can be directly ignited. 1 cubic meter of combustible ice can release 160-180 cubic meters of gas, the energy density is 10 times that of the coal, and does not produce any combustion residues and exhaust. <br> Available information shows that gas hydrate reserves are mainly found in the deep sea and terrestrial tundra. In the deep sea, which are mainly located in deepwater specific of unconsolidated sediments domain or water depth 100-250 meters below the polar continental shelf waters. Currently there are more than 40 countries to carry out the study of gas hydrates, in more than 100 countries in the world have found a physical sample, and the presence of signs of its existence, including marine 78 38 permafrost, 3 is found in China Northern South China Sea, Nansha Trough and the East China Sea continental slope. <br> <br>'
