'title'=>'China&#39;s successful trial of new jet',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'On the fourth day of August (Bingshen years), September 8, 1956, China successfully produced a new type of jet. <br> 1956 8th China successfully produced a new type of jet. <br> founding of New China, the generic production of jet fighters quickly began work. The Sino-Soviet government officially signed in October 1951, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to give the People&#39;s Republic of China Aircraft Factory in tissue repair of aircraft, engine and organizations with the technical assistance agreement. On April 18 of the same year, the heavy industries set up by the Ministry of Aviation Industry Bureau, to be responsible for the maintenance of the aircraft. Aviation Industry Bureau, end of <br> 1951, a total of 18 affiliated factories, nearly a million workers. In December 1951, Premier Zhou Enlai personally presided over the meeting decided, in 3-5 years time, a successful trial of the Soviet-made Yak -18 primary trainer and the MiG-15. The trial after fighter project instead more advanced MiG-17 jet fighter. 1954 China&#39;s first batch of aircraft and engines a successful trial, two years later, on September 8, 1956, the success of China&#39;s first jet fighters, F-5, (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) Shenyang Aircraft plant trial that MiG -17§¶ and subsequently approved mass production. China has become one of the countries at that time one of the few in the world capable of mass production of jet aircraft. <br> F-5, developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Industrial Corporation, is a single-seat, single high subsonic jet fighters, mainly used for daytime interceptor, certain-to-ground attack capability. F-5 fighter the the generic Soviet MiG-17§¶ (MiG-17F), the MiG-17F-type first flight in September, 51 years, 52 the end of mass production. The first flight test pilot Wu Keming, F-5 was known as the Type 56, until 1964, was renamed the F-5. headed by <br> Figure F-5 frame, different number painting with the existing coating. Trial work began in October 1954, and July 19, 1956, the prototype first test flight is successful, and Soviet-made parts assembled 13 F-5, 1956 July 13, 2011, all with homemade parts assembled frame F-5 to complete the final assembly. Manufactured to September 15 of that year, four made F-5 aircraft. The four aircraft participated in the 1956 National Day celebration. Discontinued until the second half of 1959, total production of 767 F-5F aircraft to support the People&#39;s Air Force construction. F-5 single-seat, single engine, the nose intake, swept monoplane layout. Swept in monoplane sweep angle is 45 ¡ã, for dual beam structure. Inboard retreating angle controllable flaps. Aileron deflection angle range of ¡À 18 ¡ã. The landing gear compartment to the main landing gear, the two tanks in the wing at the wing root. The all-metal semi-monocoque fuselage is the body of the circular cross section of flow line, nose intake. The rear fuselage equipped with steerable Speedbrakes. The vertical tail is divided into upper and lower parts, the following paragraph is fixed in the rear fuselage bearing oblique box on the upper section removable. Vertical tail sweep angle is 55 ¡ã 41 &#39;. Rudder rotatable 25 ¡ã. The horizontal tailplane sweep angle of 45 ¡ã, is mounted at the top of the vertical tail lower segment. Elevator upward rotatable 32 ¡ã down to 16 ¡ã. Tricycle landing gear are a single round. Round the cabin of the lower part of the forward fuselage of the nose landing gear income, the main undercarriage income wings. The main landing gear is equipped with a buffer, and the front landing gear equipped with shock absorbers and shimmy damper. The main wheel tire pressure of 8.34 ¡Á 105 Pa (8.5 kg / cm 2). A sealed single person cockpit emergency can throw away the hatch, the ejection seat to ensure pilots in emergency quickly and safely from the aircraft. The manipulation of the system as hard to manipulate. The aileron trim tab and elevator trim tab is electrically operated. The hydraulic system for retractable landing gear, flaps, speed brakes, adjustable vents and manipulation aileron. The air-conditioning system for the brake, sealed cockpit, emergency retractable landing gear and should slam the brakes. <br> a turbojet -5 centrifugal afterburning turbojet engine, 2600 kg static thrust with afterburning thrust of 3380 kg. The engine is the imitation of the Design Bureau in the Soviet Klimov VK-1F engine, VK-1F engine of the MiG-17. Aviation Industry Bureau was established in 1951, the engine began to organize production, learning new Soviet jet engine production technology information. The assistance of the Soviet Union, the introduction of the VK-1F patent and manufacturing rights. June 1956, the team, including our renowned engine designer Miss Grand imitation in Shenyang Aero Engine Factory (now Shenyang Liming Machinery Company \") successfully vortex spray -5 1964 production tasks transferred Xi&#39;an Hongqi Machinery Factory responsible for 66 years, converting stereotypes put into mass production. Turbojet -5 afterburning thrust of 3380 kg, with a maximum thrust of 2700 kg, 2400 kg of rated thrust, cruise thrust of 2160 kg, the different states of the fuel consumption of between 2 kg / kg / hour to 1.05 kg / kg / hour. 1170 kg of fuel in the machine, plug the two 400 liter drop tanks. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> airborne equipment including the ultrashort wave commanding station, radio compass, radio altimeter, beacon receiver, IFF, retaining Last, range finder. <br> wing swept monoplane, the aileron deflection angle of ¡À 18 degrees. Head lower left mounted the two 23-1 type 23 mm cannon, the nose lower right installed a 31-type 37 mm cannon. The loading capacity of 200 rounds. 23-1 cannon muzzle velocity of 680 m / s, the rate of fire of 800 rounds / min, shells species including Air 23-1 kill fuel, aviation 23-1 kill combustion tracer, Air 23-1 wear fuel, Air 23-1 training since bomb. 37-1 type muzzle velocity of 690 m / s, the rate of fire of 400 rounds / min, started to develop in 1954, taking into account at the beginning of the gun backward performance, the Soviet Union has been succeeding model, it is only planned a small amount of production in order to avoid wasting, and later because the F -5 increased demand, the final production of the 236 discontinued after 1959. Can be linked to two 100-250 kg bombs under the wings. <br> F-5 repeated military exploits, from July 1958 to October shoot down invading two F-84G and 6 F-86F countless other wars. Interestingly, during the Vietnam War in April 1956, four F-4 to invade our airspace Hainan Island to interception during our military F-5, F-4 launch AIM-7 \"Sparrow\" missile hurry, only to F-5 The turning radius is small to escape, the AIM-7 off target even distant flying an F-4, bringing it down. <br> F-5 for the army to develop a jet fighter, the first of its kind, to lay the foundation of our military to control the fighter jet. Currently, all F-5, has been discharged from active service. September 1958, our military F-5 fleet with the Air Force, 24 F-86 fleet over in Wenzhou, Zhejiang encounter Air Force pilot dead weight due to fall behind by 12 F-86 siege. After the the king weight stand-alone to shoot down the enemy two F-86, F-86 to carry AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles to shoot down. This is a practical world&#39;s first air-to-air missiles in the record. But the day of the F-86 launch AIM-9 situation unexploded fall after my soldiers and civilians found. While AIM-9 was sent to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, based on the successful development of the K-13 (AA-2) air-to-air missiles, China&#39;s imports of imitation that Thunderbolt -2 air-to-air missiles. However, the historical data of the National Revolutionary Army, the successful use of the AIM-9 shot down by the People&#39;s Liberation Army fighter, all combatants pilots posed for pictures, did not have any casualties. True or not remains to be seen. <br> <br>'
