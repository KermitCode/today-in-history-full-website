'cont'=>'June 8, 1916 (hare on May eighth day), discoverer of DNA Francis Crick was born. born \"target =\" _blank \"> <br> Watson and Crick Crick discovery of DNA structure in 1953, changed the the scientific outlook <br>, Francis Harry Compton ¡¤ ; Crick (Francis Harry Compton Crick 1916.6.8 - 2004.7.28) <br> was born in the capital of the south-central county of England Northamptonshire hours fond physics after graduating from high school in 1934, he was admitted to London University, Department of Physics, three years after graduating from college, then PhD However, the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 interrupted his studies, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) he entered the Navy Department to study the torpedoes, there is no achievement to be the end of the war, into the \"thirtysomething\" Crick career still nothing in 1950, his age of 34 admitted to the University of Cambridge, Department of Physics graduate degree, want the famous Cavendish experiment famous physicist Schrodinger chamber study of elementary particles. <br> At this time, Crick read a book \"What is Life\", a new era is about to begin prophesied a biology research, and that biological problems ultimately by physics and chemistry, and probably from biological research to discover new laws of physics. Crick confident that their physics knowledge to contribute to the study of biology, but the lack of chemical knowledge, began studying organic energies chemical, X-ray diffraction theory and technology, ready to explore the problem of protein structure in 1951, the United States, a 23-year-old biology Dr. Watson came to the Cavendish Laboratory, he has also been the Schrodinger \"Life is what impact. Crick hit it off with him, and began the study of the molecular structure of the genetic material - DNA. although they character at odds, but the career minded. Watson biological basis of solid, well-trained; Creek is by virtue of physical learning advantages, from traditional biology shackles, often in a new perspective to think the two of them complement each other, learn from each other, [TodayinHistory.cn] and good to absorb and learn then also studying the molecular structure of DNA abalone Lin, Wilkins and Franklin the results, the results after less than two years of efforts to complete the double helix structure of the DNA molecule model and Crick its deep scientific insights, despite Watson hesitation to adhere to them papers with DNA specific pairing principle, immediately people think of genetic material possible replication mechanism \"This sentence, so that they not only found that the molecular structure of DNA Cong structure and function of the angle made by an explanation. <br> 1962, 46-year-old Crick won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Prize along with Watson, Wilkins. <br> later grams Rick and a separate first proposed the central dogma of protein synthesis, and that the trend of the genetic code: DNA ¡ú RNA ¡ú protein he also made a contribution to research in the proportion of the genetic code and translation mechanisms. Creek, 1977 left Cambridge, to the Salk Institute in San Diego, California, as a professor. (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) In 2004 On July 28, the night, (TodayinHistory.cn), Francis Crick Thornton Hospital in San Diego, California, after a long struggle with colon cancer, died at the age of 88 years. (lssjt.cn) <br> creek are interested in two questions on the biological: a molecular from no life substance into the biological life; Second, the brain is how to generate ideas, he later realized that he had to be educated is very suitable for him to become a biophysicist at the time, he was from the impact of some of the famous physicist Pauling and Schr&#246;dinger, theoretically, the covalent bond biomolecules linking become the basis of the gene but, in fact, biologists still need to know in the end which molecule makes the whole structure of life. Creek, come to the theory of evolution by natural selection Darwin and Mendel made genetically together, will be able to get the secret of life, but when his consciousness. to the natural form of life how difficult, he said: \"an honest man, no matter know how much, we can only say that the origin of life is almost a miracle, because the number of conditions that need to be reached ah!\" In short, he said own atheistic skeptics \"strong preference\" (\"a strong inclination towards atheism\"). <br>'
