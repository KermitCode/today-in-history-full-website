'cont'=>'Chuba April (πÔ”œ to), May 8, 1813, the French physiologist Bernard&#39;s birthday. <br> French physiologist. July 12, 1813 (since 199 years) born in Œ¨¿’∏•¿  ≤ France, died in Paris on February 10, 1878. School of Medicine, the College de France in Paris in 1834 to study medicine. As interns during the 1839 Physiology Laboratory Professor F. Magendie help that to work. Medical school in 1843. By the end of 1847 to become the the Magendie official assistant. The after the Magendie retirement in 1852, he succeeded Magendie became professor of physiology and director of the Laboratory of Physiology of the College de France. March 1853 to obtain a doctorate in zoology from the University of Paris. In 1854, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. 1854 to 1868 either Professor of Physiology of the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, and transferred professor of physiology at the Museum of Natural History in 1868. In 1869, he was appointed president of the French Academy of Sciences. him in the creation of experimental techniques, the discovery of scientific facts and the establishment of the new concept <br> he learned in the long-term cooperation with Magendie vivisection as physiology research than his teacher, and become one of the founders of modern physiology. He found: liver function generate glycogen vasomotor nerve control, pancreatic juice to digest fats, the nature and role of curare in the Americas, as well as carbon monoxide toxicity. He abandoned sugar was recognized animal blood directly from the food, and animals can not synthesize polysaccharides understanding, with a large number of experimental facts show that: blood sugar is not directly from the food but from the liver, the liver can glucose synthesis of glycogen storage up liver glycogen can be decomposed into glucose back to the blood for the body required. He made an important complement to the AL Lavoisier \"breathing is slow combustion (i.e. oxidation) insights that the direct combustion of the oxidation process of the living body is not oxygen and carbon, but through the role of the enzyme occurs indirectly oxidation. The location of the oxidation is not only lung, and all the tissues of the body. He does not agree with the \"vitalism\" popular at the time, and firmly believe that the vitality of chemical forces. Bernard began to explore since 1851, formally proposed biological \"internal environment\" concept in 1857. That living things in the outside environment, it is customary the various organizations vivo life in the biological environment. The stability of the internal environment is a prerequisite for the existence of life; internal environment should always maintain a balance with the outside environment, otherwise life was going to occur disorder. Still an important influence in his thinking in this regard. Published in 1865, his book \"Introduction to Experimental Medicine is considered a milestone in the history of the development of physiology. His death, a state funeral in France. (Lssjt.cn) <br>'
