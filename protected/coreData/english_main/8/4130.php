'cont'=>'May 8, 1654 (Sino-Japanese March 22), Germany Magdeburg hemispheres experiment. <br> at that time in the 17th century, Germany has a love of science mayor, named Gehrig. He is erudite soldiers, always liked to listen to the story of Galileo; hobbies reading, hobbies, science; been read to the University of Leipzig. The University of Jena in 1621 and studied law; 1623, to the University of Leiden to study mathematics and mechanics. He read the three universities, a wide range of knowledge, Shangzhi astronomy under knowledge geographic; mathematical law, philosophy, engineering, etc., all-knowing, nothing unreasonable. Therefore, he can live in the Military; but also gain a foothold in politics; speak better in the scientific community. He joined the army in 1631, served in the army ordnance engineers, the work is very good. Later, join the political, and in 1646 was elected mayor of Magdeburg. Either in the military or in the city government, did not stop the scientific exploration. <br> 1654, he heard Torricelli thing, and I heard that there are a lot of people do not believe that atmospheric pressure; heard a few people laugh at Torricelli; longer heard the debate between a very heated , refused to give tit for tat. , (Lssdjt.com) Glick away from Italy, Germany, but it is against injustice, indignation. <br> he hurriedly got the glass tube and mercury, re-do Torricelli this experiment, concluded that this experiment is accurate; suck out the air in then a seal intact barrel, barrel & ldquo ; bang! \"Sound atmosphere\" pressure \"is broken! <br> One day, he and his aides made into two hemispheres, 14 inches in diameter, that is more than 30 cm, and brought in a team of people to start a large-scale experiment \"on the outskirts of the city. <br> this year on May 8 this day, the beautiful city of Magdeburg, bright and sunny, blue skies, very hearty, a large number of people around the experimental field, hee hee yell very lively. Some said this, and some said that; Some support Glick, hope that the experiment was a success; Some assert that the experiment will fail; people talking about in the debate; in anticipating; Still others side streets Lane ran to the experimental field, while loudly shouting: <br> \"Mayor circus! Mayor circus - \"<br> Glick and assistant public brass hemispherical shell intermediate mat rubber band; then the two hemispheres together filled with water; then all out of the water the ball to form a vacuum; Finally, tighten the gas mouth leading closed. At this time, the atmosphere surrounding the two hemispheres pressed tightly together. <br> Glick a wave four groom led to the the eight high horses, each tied to four on both sides of the ball. Glick gave the order, the four groom Swagger Cuima, runs counter to pull! Seems like in the \"tug of war\". <br> \"Come on! Come on! \"Experimental field dense mass of people the side neatly shouting side beats. <br> 4 groom, eight Malaysians, are made so sweaty. However, the copper ball is still intact. Glick had shook his hand pause. <br> then, around two teams, men doubled. The groom have to drink more water, wipe the sweat on the forehead, and in preparation for the second performance. <br> Glick then a wave experimental field is very lively. 16 Malaysia, Sijin tensile eight groom loudly shout shouting whiplash Cuima ...... crowd <br> experiments on more craned his neck, looking at a trial of strength, from time to time issue, \"Wow! Wow! \"The sound. <br> suddenly, \"WHACK! \"A loud noise, ball split into two halves, Glick lifted two heavy hemisphere to proudly and loudly declared: <br>\" Gentlemen! Ladies! Citizens! Do you believe it! Some is the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric pressure is so powerful! So amazing! \"<br> The end of the experiment are still some people do not understand the two hemispheres Why not pull open, rushes to ask him, he patiently for a detailed explanation:\" In peacetime, we close together and the two hemispheres, without force, it will separate. This is because the role of the outside atmospheric pressure in the ball in the ball; mutually offset balance. Does not seem to like atmospheric effects. Today, I put it pumped into a vacuum, no outward atmospheric pressure the ball, only the ball outside the atmosphere tightly to suppress the two hemispheres .... \" <br> through this large-scale experiment, people have come to believe there is a vacuum; atmosphere; atmospheric pressure; atmospheric pressure is amazing, However, for this experiment, Glick mayor actually spent &#163; 4,000 . <br>'
