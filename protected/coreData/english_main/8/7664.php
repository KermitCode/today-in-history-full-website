'cont'=>'August 8, 1901 (June 24, 1901), American physicist Thomas Lawrence was born. <br> Lawrence was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Lawrence and his cyclotron <br>, 1901, American physicist Lawrence the birth of <br> Thomas Lawrence (TE Lawrence ), born August 8, 1901 American physicist any physics at Yale University teaching assistant in 1927, after an associate professor at the University of California in 1930, he was promoted to professor in 1929, the beginning of the idea of &#8203;&#8203;the cyclotron. the his students Livingston design and able to hydrogen ions (protons) accelerated to 13,000 electron volts of energy devices. manufactured to proceed with the construction of the second cyclotron can accelerate the protons to 120 million electron volts, which is enough to cause nuclear transmutation order to continue this plan Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, either laboratory director in 1936 the world&#39;s first man-made element technetium is Lawrence&#39;s cyclotron. Lawrence&#39;s basic design is also used in other particle accelerators, particle great advances in physics, mainly achieved by these accelerators. Lawrence invented the first high-energy particle accelerator - cyclotron, Nobel physics prize in 1939 during World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project, charge of the manufacture of the atomic bomb using uranium-235 isolated electromagnetic method. U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in 1957 granted him Fermi bonuses. He also invented the color television picture tubes and patented California at Berkeley and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, 103 element lawrencium are named to commemorate his <br> 1958 8, 27, died <br> Comments: The invention of the cyclotron research on nuclear fission and nuclear forces play a particularly important role in . <br>'
