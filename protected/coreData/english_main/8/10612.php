'cont'=>'November 8, 1993 (September 25) πÔ”œ&#39;s first high Reynolds number wind tunnel built. <br> 1993 11, China&#39;s first high Reynolds number transonic the 2D pipe wind tunnel built recently in the mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This device is an international leader in the consolidated level. <br> high Reynolds number transonic wind tunnel is essential in the aircraft developed ground test equipment. The aircraft aerodynamic test analog parameters of the flight Mach number and Reynolds number, conventional transonic wind tunnel can simulate Mach number, but the Reynolds number value 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the actual flight. The actual flight aerodynamic phenomenon sensitive to changes with Reynolds number, according to conventional transonic wind tunnel experiment data design aircraft often cause problems. Chinese Academy of Mechanics, which lasted five years to build China&#39;s first high Reynolds number transonic 2D tube wind tunnel, the advanced airfoil for our research, construction transonic Reynolds number higher and larger pipe wind tunnel laid a solid technical foundation . <br>'
