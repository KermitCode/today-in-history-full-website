'cont'=>'In June (Bingyin first two days), July 8, 1986, China&#39;s domestic satellite communication network built. <br> when he was the Vice-Premier of the State Council Li Peng for domestic satellite communication CAPE pass the ribbon-cutting ceremony and delivered an important speech <br> After two years of efforts, China&#39;s domestic satellite communication network officially completed on July 8, 1986. <br> communications satellite is 36,000 km above the Earth above the equator, geostationary satellites as relay stations to achieve the modernization of regional communication. Currently, more than 20 countries in the world to establish a domestic satellite communication network. China&#39;s domestic satellite communication network built, marking China&#39;s telecommunications industry Youxiang modern forward step. For the transfer of national integrated television and television educational programs, create a good way. It to improve our posts and telecommunications in remote areas backward state, also played an important role. <br> China has a vast territory, the existing open wire, cable, microwave communications network has been unable to meet the needs of modernization. Satellite communications are an important means of communication for modern aerospace technology and is the rapid development of electronic technology combined generated. Than with open wire, cable, microwave, and other means of communication, satellite communication transmission distance, large capacity communication, communication quality construction and low cost advantages. China&#39;s satellite communication network rental and purchase of international satellite communications organization in the Indian Ocean over the satellite transponder, you can link up the five earth stations in Beijing, Lhasa, Urumqi, Hohhot, Guangzhou, covering all the territory of our country. semi-automatic long distance between Beijing to Urumqi, Hohhot, Lhasa, telephone, telegraph, data and facsimile services <br> Currently, has been opened; same time, Beijing&#39;s Central Station CCTV instructional television program and the State Board of Education Correspondence sent to the nation program, the national television receiving station of 400 and 100, respectively, to receive timely, sent to thousands of families and the local relay stations. <br> Since 1984, China has successfully launched a five communications satellites, five satellites and international satellite transponder leased, consisting of practical communication, broadcasting space systems. Satellite communication ground stations in China has grown to more than 40, and nearly 200 data transfer station, satellite TV reception station is about 15,000. The opening of the domestic satellite communication network will not only help solve communication urgently needed in remote provinces, autonomous regions, and some departments, but also as an important means of transmission of long-distance communication, enhance communication network mobility, reliability, promote the exchange of information and economic development , has important significance. <br>'
