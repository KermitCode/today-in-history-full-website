'cont'=>'March 9, 1997 (, Landmarks in February, the first day), Whole Foods and comets in Mohe camp. <br> U.S. amateur astronomers the Haier (left) and Pope In 1997 3, 9, 9 hours and 7 minutes 40 seconds to 9 minutes and 30 seconds, Mohe County, Heilongjiang Province, the total solar eclipse the rare astronomical phenomena. Instant black canopy, Hale - Bopp comet looming. Of over 80,000 Mohe residents and more than 3,000 Chinese and foreign experts and amateur astronomers scene feel strong view, the universe. (History. Com) <br> total solar eclipse is the moon run to date, to the middle, a rare phenomenon appears to block the sun. The total solar eclipse occurred in 俄罗斯斯比克, and north of the Altai region of Xinjiang, swept Mongolia, China, Mohe, and finally end in the Arctic Ocean. The eclipse Bring only the city of Mohe, good basic conditions, the solar elevation angle is moderate, to become the world&#39;s best observation points. Daily dawn-dusk is now Hale - Bopp comet has risen to the zenith Bottom visible hastily. <br> our last total solar eclipse of this century, the reunification in 2400, Hale - Bopp comet encounter - this century tryst \"aroused great interest of the Chinese and foreign scientists and amateur astronomers. To 10 pm 19 pm from early losses today eclipse 8:02:34, 45 seconds recovery process, scientists are using optical, radio, and other means to collect large amounts of data. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ye Shuhua, Wang Daheng 7 were also at the scene. the <br> century comet Hale - Bopp Comet Hale - Bopp Northern Lights Xiangying hui <br> 1995 July 23, 2011, two amateur astronomers in the United States Haier and Pop observing Sagittarius globular cluster M70, accidentally discovered a new comet. The calculation results of the preliminary observations allow astronomers to vigorously shock: It did run on a very special track, almost perpendicular to its orbital plane of the solar system plane, that is, it will be from the south to the north to bypass the sun and then deep into space, so this comets will provide us with the solar poles physical state and the edge of the solar system special orientation of the original information. <br> more striking is its unusual brightness, and found it 10 million kilometers from Earth, and brightness than 10, the same distance 250 times brighter than Halley&#39;s Comet in 1985 reunification . After astronomers calculate when the alternate star after perihelion brightness will reach -1.7, the brightest Sirius than throughout the day but also bright, it is known as the end of the century the Great Comet. <br> Hale - Bopp did not disappoint, and the development of its shape and brightness are basically consistent with the estimates: the nucleus experienced at least five times the outbreak, and a short and thick dust tail. January 1997 to February gas tail appearances outset longer. And maintain the two main and tail, to April or so. March 23, 1997 over the perigee, to April 1st perihelion, brightest reached -0.8. \"Haier - Pop\" is a comprehensive use of human history as a CCD (record images with electronic scanning system) technology for a long time observing the comet, therefore greatly improved the quality of the photo. <br>'
