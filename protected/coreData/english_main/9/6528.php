'cont'=>'July 9, 1911 (, Xinhai June 14), the famous American physicist John Archibald Wheeler was born. <br> John Archibald Wheeler was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Wheeler, John Archibald Wheeler <br> famous American physicist, physics the thinker and physics education home. born July 9, 1911 in Florida, United States, Wheeler lifetime is a Fellow of the American Academy of Natural Sciences and the Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a former chairman of the American Physical Society. Wheeler was educated at the College of Baltimore (Baltimore City College) and Johns ¡¤ ; Hopkins University (Johns Hopkins University), Ph.D. of 1933, after research in nuclear physics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, the famous physicist Dan Maini Boer guidance, after teaching at Princeton University and the University of Texas. had participate in \"Manhattan\" program in the United States, which in 1937, Wheeler proposed the concept of scattering matrix particle interaction he and Dan Maini Pohl, Francoeur, the former Soviet Union in 1939 proposed heavy nuclei droplet model theory of fission. <br> period in the 1950s or earlier, then the general theory of relativity is still largely a branch of mathematics, it introduces physics, mainly thanks to Wheeler 1957 meters Flexner began to develop \"geometric dynamics, gravitation, electromagnetic fields, mass, charge as the nature of the bending of empty space to explain the attempt to physics completely geometric 1965\" Einstein Award & rdquo ; Wheeler meeting in New York in 1969 to use the term \"black hole\", from this dissemination World. December 2, 1968, then U.S. President Lyndon Johnson awarded to Wheeler grace of the Atomic Energy Commission Lick Fermi Award, 1982 \"Bohr International Gold Medal\" in 1983, he proposed a participatory universe perspective. the Matteucci Medal in 1993. 2008 April 13, 2010, suffering from pneumonia treatment failed, passed away at home in the New Jersey, at the age of 96 years. <br> In order to explain the collapse of massive supergiant star in the universe phenomenon, (the l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) Wheeler to create a \"black hole.\" quite succinct, pertinent, broad vocabulary. addition, Wheeler still in the field of nuclear fission research to obtain creative results, selected uranium-235 as the raw materials for making bombs, the first Americans engaged in the theoretical study of the atomic bomb, he had engaged in The development of the hydrogen bomb in the unified field study, a considerable achievement. Wheeler great achievements in quantum theory and research on the theory of relativity, he also created such as \"wormholes\" and \"quantum foam\" vocabulary, and became a physics in the important terms. <br> Wheeler addition to love to swim, and he also likes to work in the woods, even leisure time, he is also thinking about physical problems over ninety years of age, living in New Jersey Wheeler still adhere week bus to Princeton twice, likes to mingle with young people, he said, get new information in their dealings with the young The OpenCourseWare Comments: The creation of a \"black hole\", \"Wormholes & rdquo ; vocabulary and \"quantum foam\" and become important terms in physics. <br>'
