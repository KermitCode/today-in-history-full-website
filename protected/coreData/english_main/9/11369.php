'cont'=>'December 9, 1968 (, Shigenobu October 20,), the world&#39;s first mouse available. In In December 1968 the Stanford Institute ¶÷¸ñÀ×±´ÌØ Dr. public display of the world&#39;s first mouse, and put forward the concept of the graphical user interface (GUI) of. <br> 1968, the world&#39;s first mouse was born in California, Stanford University, its inventor Dr. Douglas Englebart. The original intention of the Englebart Dr. design mouse is easier in order to make the operation of the computer instead of the keyboard that tedious instruction. He produced mouse is a small wooden boxes, the working principle is driven by it at the bottom of the smaller ball pivot and driven by the rheostat to change resistance to generate the displacement signal, the signal processed by computer, the cursor on the screen can be moved. Since then, the mouse and the PC have forged a bond with the kind of difficult to express in words. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) <br> Since With the computer, the keyboard has accompanied it, has been playing the role of the primary input device. Typing at the keyboard is really good, but is used to move the cursor, it shows its limitations. So, to deal with the computer all day working in NASA Engel Bert had a bold idea --- \"point of control\" method instead of typing on the keyboard? <br> < ; br> later December 9, 1968 as the mouse&#39;s birthday <br> After years of efforts, in 1982, Engel Bert&#39;s idea finally become a reality: a product called \"display system cursor position The vertical and horizontal movement indicator products come out. Its role, and control the movement of the cursor on the screen, instead of the Enter key. However, its name is too long, it is inconvenient to call. (History cn) <br> one day, laboratory work in Engel Bert, a display the system cursor position Aspect move the pointer to fall from the computer on the table, because of the connection with the host connected to it hanging in the air, like the one dragging the long tail of the mouse, this scene triggered Engel Bert&#39;s inspiration from the side, so \"Show the system cursor position vertical and horizontal movement indicator\" will have a \"Mouse & rdquo ; (mouse) name. When such a computer input device \"Mouse\" is used in our country, the people will it translated as \"mouse\", aptly reflects the appearance and function of this device. (History. Cn) <br> mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964, when DouglasEngelbart working at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), the Institute is an organization sponsored by the Stanford University, Douglas Engelbart very early in the consider how to make the computer easier to use, and what means to replace the tedious commands from the keyboard input. early <br> 60, he participated in a meeting to hand out portable notebook (not a laptop oh), draw a bottom two perpendicular wheels to track the movements of the device sketch This is the prototype of the mouse. In 1964, Douglas Engelbart again to perfect the idea of &#8203;&#8203;such a device, hands-on production of the first one finished. Douglas Engelbart also referred to as a the mouse father of. <br> was also the name of the \"mouse\", this new device is a small wooden box, which has two wheels, but only one button. Its working principle is driven by the roller shaft is rotated, and changing resistance rheostat resistance change to produce displacement signals, processed by computer is indicated on the screen position of the cursor can be moved. Since the device like a mouse dragging a long connection (like a rat&#39;s tail), therefore, Douglas Engelbart and his colleagues in the laboratory it play called \"Mouse\", he was also thought of the future mouse may be widely applied in patent applications and called it a \"display system XY position indicator\", but people think the name \"Mouse\" more people are friendly, the so called \"mouse\" . the <br> Comments: computer mouse instead of the keyboard that tedious instruction operation easier, the ancestors of the modern mouse. <br>'
