'cont'=>'July 9, 1856 (, hare on June eighth day), the famous chemist Avogadro&#39;s death. The Avogadro <br> the death of the \"target =\" _blank \"> Avogadro (AmeldeoAvogardo, 1776 ~ 1856) Italian physicist, chemist, was born in Turin on August 9, 1776 to an aristocratic family. August 9, 1792 into the University of Turin, studied law, 1796, JD, later worked as a lawyer from 1800 to 1805 and specialized study mathematics and physics, and later major in physics, chemistry research. <br> 1811, the proposed molecular says: molecules composed of atoms. launched the same volume of gas at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules, also known as Avogadro&#39;s law. (lssdjt.cn) <br> 1803 year he published the first scientific paper in 1809, he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at Vercelli College. was elected to the Academy of Sciences of Turin in 1811. <br> Avogadro&#39;s devoted his life to the study of atoms - Molecular Theory in 1811, he published a paper entitled \"Determination of the ratio of the number of atoms relative quality measurement methods and atomic compounds\" thesis to cover the Lussac gas compounds volume than the experimental basis, a reasonable assumptions and reasoning, first introduced the concept of \"molecular and atomic concept phase difference, pointed out that atoms are the smallest particles that participate in the chemical reaction, the molecule is the smallest particles can exist independently. single mass molecules by the same elements atoms and molecules of the compound by the atoms of different elements. clearly pointed out: \"You must admit that there is a very simple relationship between the simple molecule or compound the number of molecules in the volume and composition of the gaseous substances gaseous substances linking them, or even only allow the assumption, is equal to the number of molecules of all gases in the same volume, so you can make the atomic weight of the gas, the molecular weight and molecular composition of the determination of the physical, chemical, has been is fully consistent with the law of Avogadro&#39;s hypothesis, later known as Avogadro&#39;s law. Avogadro, (lssdjt.cn) <br>, also according to the law of his detailed study method of determination of molecular weight and atomic weight, but his method of long-term for the people to accept, this is due to the scientific community can not distinguish between molecules and atoms, molecules hypothesis is difficult to understand, plus the chemical authority refused to accept the molecular the point of view of the hypothesis, resulting in the obscurity of his hypothesis on hold for half a century, this is undoubtedly a great pity that in the history of science until 1860, the Italian chemist Cannizzaro in an international chemistry meeting vehemently claimed that his own people Avogadro half a century ago has been solved to determine the atomic weight of the problem. Cannizzaro full argument, clearly structured, easy-to-understand approach, and soon the majority of chemists believe A of Gadereau the doctrine is generally correct but when Avogadro has been a few years ago quietly died, did not see the victory of his doctrine. <br> Avogadro was the first recognize substance composed of molecules, molecules composed of atoms. molecular hypothesis laid the atomic part of On the basis, to promote the development of physics, chemistry, and had a profound influence on modern science. his four volume book \"The weight of the physics of the object\" (1837 to 1841) is the first tutorial on molecular physics. <br> 1856 Avogadro died in Turin. < br>'
