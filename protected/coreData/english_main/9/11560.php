I believe that this view is terribly wrong, and the globalization of the world economy has suffered in the crisis of the Chinese economy. the <br> import and export industry: cusp <br> in the global financial turmoil, in the most direct and most serious impact on the cusp of China&#39;s import and export industries are. First, the crisis has shifted from the financial level the economic level, the weakened U.S. consumer direct impact on China&#39;s exports to the United States. U.S. consumer spending accounts for more than 70% of GDP, the size of the domestic consumption of about $ 10 trillion in 2007, while Chinese consumer spending is about $ 1 trillion over the same period.

(On TodayOnHistory.com) <br> iron and steel, non-ferrous metals industry: the specter of <br> as the world&#39;s largest steel producer and exporter of steel, China&#39;s steel exports in 2006 reached 43 million tons in 2007 reached 62.64 million tons, 1 August 2008, affected by the global financial crisis, exports of steel 41.84 million tons, a year-on-year decrease of 3.25 million tons, down 7.2%. Reduction in steel exports, coupled with the downturn of the real estate, shipbuilding, automobiles, three major sectors in the market on the sharp drop in demand for steel, domestic steel stocks are on the rise. In addition to the small and medium steel mills, Baosteel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Tangshan Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, Sha Steel and other large steel mills production line turns scheduling overhaul in the name of limited production. <br> influenced by the financial crisis, in addition to the steel industry, copper, aluminum and other non-ferrous metals industry. Coexistence of foreign non-ferrous metals market, spot and futures, copper and other non-ferrous metals futures derivative financial instruments outstanding attributes, price movements are closely related to the financial situation, is closely associated with the virtual economy and real economy of goods. The intensification of the international financial crisis, investors lost confidence in almost all financial instruments, to evacuate the futures market, a direct result of derivative financial instruments, including non-ferrous metals futures prices fell. China is the world&#39;s largest non-ferrous metal producer and consumer countries, non-ferrous metal prices plummeted, not only have an important influence on the production and operation of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry, will also affect the related industries, and thus have an impact on the national economy as a whole runs. author&#39;s answer is yes <br> other industry: spared <br> to the other industries will be the impact of the financial crisis? \"Gates of fire, adverse impacts to fish.\" The global financial crisis will spread to other industries through the following three channels. First, the consumer demand of the residents are greatly reduced. One hand, brought about by the financial crisis, stock market crash, investors assets shrink, weakening the real purchasing power of some residents, the \"negative effect\" on the wealth of the stock market correction will be an unprecedented show. On the other hand, the financial crisis many uncertainties and potential risks, the level of fear of the people of the risk of the general rise in the not too optimistic about future employment and income expectations, poor income expectations, residents will compress some non- necessary for the consumer. Second, affected by the overall macro-economic environment, business investment and a general lack of confidence, there will be \"cautious credit\" phenomenon, so that the decline in investment demand. Third, the global financial system is in turmoil, the significant increase in non-performing assets of banks, in order to avoid the risk, they will improve their credit standards, corporate loans and personal consumer credit more difficult. These will reduce the total social demand, deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, and thus have an impact on various industries. <br>'
