Share We are to comply with the treaty, but we are suffering from Italy all sides cries can not remain indifferent - Victor Emmanuel II On Government must support Italy over the anti-Olympic movement <br> ( : A Chol) mention of Italian independence movement, people will think of Italy founding three heroes Mazzini, Cavour, Garibaldi&#39;s great achievements, of course, as their backing, the founding monarch Victor Emmanuel II the role can not be ignored. (1 $ dj¶”.c®≠m), compared with almost the same age independence movement in Germany, the situation faced by the Italian independence movement is more complex, more difficult, therefore, can not figure such as Bismarck Yili dyke the efforts of the three heroes are indispensable, and King Victor Emmanuel in more subtle role. over Italy <br> Despite a common language, a common culture, a common national identity, but since the Roman Empire has never been unified under the same regime, in the 9th century, there have been a Charlie Man descendants ruled the Kingdom of Italy, the scope of its ruling with the the Modern Italian national boundary vastly different. Divided, Italy suffered in the history of contention and destruction of neighboring countries, France, Germany, Spain, Austria, and even the Arab Empire, the Ottoman Empire, have ignited before the war here. <br> With the rise of 19th century European nationalist thinking, passionate young people in Italy national unity identified as a goal, but look at the situation from the 1840s, the unification of Italy seems to be a distant dream . The situation at that time, in northern Italy&#39;s Lombardy and Venice occupied Austria, central Italy, has a large number of small duchy, Tuscan, Parma, Austria they are inextricably linked, or Austrian garrison, or monarchy itself from Austria.

In addition, there is a Kingdom of Sardinia, also known as the Piedmont, ruled the two parts of Piedmont and Sardinia, its king from the Italian mainland. The Sardinian king <br> Victor Emmanuel is in this critical year of 1849. His family called the Savoy family, is an old prominent family in Italy, have their own territory from the 11th century onwards. The territory of the Savoy family, after generations of extended, 18th century finally became the Kingdom of Sardinia.

His youth had received strict despotism education also tend to strengthen the dictatorship of the monarch, but the test of the revolution in 1940s to increase the political flexibility, tolerate liberal ideas, retained in 1848 promulgated Constitution, the Italian princes only retain the form of a constitutional system of the country, and this is important, only the liberal support, it may be Italy&#39;s great cause of reunification. Ayman Nur throne <br> Viktor second year, the Cabinet sharp a thinking, resourceful character stand out, he is when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer Ghafoor, from a noble, is a very successful businessman 1847 founded the \"renaissance\" as a starting point, went to the front desk of the era. In 1852, the king appointed Cavour cabinet, began a course of cooperation of two of the past 10 years. Cooperation between them, just as the era of William I and Bismarck as outsiders seems to be very successful, but the potholes, the only parties to appreciate men. Cavour was caused because of a blow to the church forces pious King and the Queen Mother&#39;s dissatisfaction, resentment of the king also urged the king and the French marriage, even after the signing of the \"Œ¨¿≠∏•¿ º” Peace Treaty\" also once left, but two based on a rational politician, or promote this cooperation has become a model of success in the history of world politics. after <br> Ghafoor prime minister, the first in the country for some purposes to Fuguoqiangbing reforms, including incentives for Industry to promote trade, undermine Church authority, he allows a certain degree of freedom of expression, in particular by allowing The newspapers published a fierce anti-Austrian article. At the same time arms expansion to increase soldiers amount, obviously in preparation for a war. But just to have the power of the Sardinian Government is impossible to achieve a unified, very clear that this monarch. Sardinian country took part in the Crimean War, into fighting on the side of Britain and France, closer distance with Britain and France. 1858, Cavour and the French Emperor Napoleon III reached an agreement, Napoleon sent troops 200,000 the upcoming Saao war help solve the problem, after the recapture of Lombardy and Venice Sardinian country ceded Savoy and Nice as a reward . (Lsjt.net) <br> proudly and confidently when the court of Turin is authentic when good equipment, folk Mazzini also efforts in another way, he continued to manufacture the uprising and assassination, but like breaks against the face of the rock-solid old forces only hero again and again shed tears. At this time, it touches another folk hero is playing an increasingly important role, he is the Garibaldi. Italian democrats do not want to cooperate, and the king, do not want to join the army, so, Garibaldi will be playing under the banner of \"volunteers\" to absorb them, so that they reported to the state-owned door Sardinian Government to establish Volunteers Garibaldi funds and other support. <br> 1859, a long-awaited war finally broke out.

Then, despite the opposition of Cavour Garibaldi, through the Strait offensive Naples corrupt and backward kingdom of Naples, unable to withstand such a blow, and they turned it into the smoke, subsequently Garibaldi Southern Italy hand over Viktor Ai Manuel, not so much his loyalty to the king, rather than his loyalty to the ideal of the unification of Italy.
