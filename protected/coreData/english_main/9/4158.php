'cont'=>'May 9, 1996 (March 22), Rat, developed by China&#39;s first domestically cyclotron. <br> China has independently developed the first cyclotron production of radioisotopes, May 9, 1996, by the acceptance of the State Planning Commission. This indicates that the cyclotron developed technology in China has stepped into the international advanced level in the 1990s. <br> the day of acceptance of the \"intensity proton cyclotron and production of short-lived isotopes device\", the successful development of the China Institute of Atomic Energy. The accelerators developed technology in the world&#39;s high-tech sector is the focus of a competitive <br> It is understood. Accelerator neutron-deficient isotope production, is widely used in industry, agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry, the production does not come out in a nuclear reactor. The use of neutron-deficient isotope diagnosis and treatment of disease, is an important part of the current world&#39;s most advanced medical science and technology. The past, our use of the neutron-deficient isotopes and their products or drugs, mostly dependent on imports. However, the shorter the life of the neutron-deficient isotope, coupled with intense international competition, the neutron-deficient isotopes of imports will be restricted. <br> China Institute of Atomic Energy from 1988 to this development work. The researchers created a unique three-dimensional calculation of the magnetic field, more than two-dimensional computing technologies for advanced work to master. The cyclotron production capacity developed 5 times higher than similar products. Participate in the acceptance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, domestic accelerator experts Chen Jiaer, this device has a \"strong high flow, high efficiency, high intelligence, high starting point and size ramp. The trial run for more than a year to produce cobalt-57 and thallium-201, gallium-67, indium-111, germanium 68 cadmium 109 and fluorine-18 radioisotope. Some hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai and other places of the use the quality to meet Chinese Pharmacopoeia reach the level of advanced countries. It is gratifying that some isotopes have been exported to the United States and other countries and regions. <br> China&#39;s first with a the accelerator mass production and supply of radioisotopes base has been established at the China Institute of Atomic Energy. <br>'
