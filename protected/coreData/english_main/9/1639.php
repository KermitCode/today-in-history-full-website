'cont'=>'February 9, 1998 (, 13 Tiger years the first month), our transgenic sheep research was a major breakthrough. <br> three transgenic goats are someone coagulation factor IX gene integration, the right one has entered lactation milk containing human clotting factor IX activity protein. (Has been the integration of five human coagulation factor IX gene transgenic goats, which one has to secrete human clotting factor IX activity of protein) <br> Upon a testing ground for new animal in Shanghai, with a distinctive dairy goat, this goat The secretion of milk containing coagulation factor IX haemophilia desired active protein. This protein through a special refining, will become a drug treatment for people with hemophilia. This shows that our transgenic sheep research has achieved a major breakthrough. Professor Zeng Yitao, Chinese Academy of Sciences, published February 9, 1998 at the Shanghai Institute of Medical Genetics, State Key Laboratory Academic Committee meeting. <br>'
