At this time, William began his ambitions to invest across the England. <br> At that time, the king of England Edward the Confessor (1042-1066 reign), William&#39;s cousin, had no children, said of William&#39;s visit to Britain in 1051, he agreed to let William inherited his throne. brother-in-law of Edward the Confessor, another throne strong competition by Harold trapped in the Dukedom of Normandy, also admitted before William the right to inherit the throne of England, but when in 1066, the death of Edward the Confessor, Edward recommend the England Witan elected Harold as king. William hearing the anger can not be dried, and then determined to wage his wars of conquest. <br> when William of persons and goods cross-sea combat ready, everything is ready, only a strong southwest wind, has hope not delay forty multiple days. later history has proven, it is 40 days waiting to change the balance of power, so the outcome scales in favor of William party. <br> then another English throne Challenger - Knut King Emperor&#39;s offspring, Norwegian King Harald III first landed in the north of England, is the southern coastal waiting for William Harold, and against forced to troops on the north.

(history com) <br> William the Conqueror&#39;s conquest of history is so in Britain since since the era of the Roman Empire again be involved in the complex relations of the European Centre region (Prior to conquer Britain, but the degree of civilization than the UK behind Norman), because the king has in French territory, the British and French royal family to become a reason constantly shear and chaotic the enemy, after hundreds of years in the two countries&#39; exchanges and conflicts become political life in Western Europe, one of the main themes of this conquest of England changed the historical process, and even the English are changed, a lot of new words added English. many new things into the island, such as the jury system, and later the British legal self-contained, is this originator of Wilhelm I (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> Normandy tradition of centralization domination and military statehood into the United Kingdom, is a major turning point in British history. Prior to this, the United Kingdom has been been invaded, conquered the object from his British to turn defense into attack, after the war mainly only in others territory, although these two traditions gradually fade in the future development of the UK. <br> Review: England several hundred years have been subjected to attacks and harassment of Nordic Norman, but ultimately conquer the island, but it is historical events from the other side of the French Normans. Norman Conquest looks like a chance, in fact it&#39;s happening is the result of historical trend, that is, the island of Great Britain is difficult to avoid the mainland and Europe increasingly close contact, and ultimately can only be fully integrated into the European political system. <br>'
