'cont'=>'(Landmarks April third), May 9, 1997, Jiang Zemin accepted an interview with CNN. <br> Jiang Zemin accepted an interview with U.S. reporters, talked about the problems of Sino-US relations and Taiwan. In May <br> 1997, President Jiang Zemin met in Zhongnanhai with CNN president Tom Johnson, accepted an interview with the television network correspondents in Beijing, Chen Menglan. <br> which, when a reporter asked China and the United States whether or not to conflict, President Jiang Zemin said, I do not think that the Sino-US conflict. Chinese history stricken victims of foreign aggression and expansion. The Chinese government and the Chinese people love peace, wholeheartedly committed to the development of the economy, improve people&#39;s living standards. We have always pursued an independent foreign policy of peace, is to securing a long-term peace and security of the external environment for domestic economic development efforts. China&#39;s military power completely is the nature of self-defense, our defense spending budget this year is less than $ 10 billion, compared with the United States and other major powers, China&#39;s military spending and armament levels are very low. China has never been the intent of the \"expansion\". As for some people invented the so-called \"Cold War mentality\" China threat theory \", I believe that the peoples of the world, including the people of the United States, including on this argument, is the ability to make the right judgment. <br> the Taiwan issue, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that the Taiwan issue concerns China&#39;s sovereignty, territorial integrity and the great cause of reunification, is always the most important and most sensitive issue in Sino-US relations. Improper handling of the Taiwan issue, Sino-US relations will suffer setbacks, it is difficult to get a healthy and stable development. The three Sino-US joint communiques, constitute the basis of Sino-US relations, the core issue is the Taiwan issue. The U.S. communique recognizes only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China, (Lssdjt.com) the Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China, promised to pursue the \"one China\" policy. I hope the U.S. government on the Taiwan issue cautiously disposal, and no longer allow this issue to interfere with and influence the improvement and development of Sino-US relations. President Jiang also said that Hong Kong, Macau is the historical issues between China and relevant countries, the Taiwan issue is left over from the civil war in China, is an internal issue. Problems with the Hong Kong and Macao have resolved, I believe that the Taiwan issue will certainly be able to solve the reunification of the motherland is completed. <br>'
