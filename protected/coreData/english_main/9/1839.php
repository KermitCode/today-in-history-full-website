'cont'=>'March 9, 1985 (the Yi Chou the first month XVIII), National Model Worker Cary&#39;s death. 9, <br> 1985 National Model Worker, in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province Agricultural vice president Cary died aged 78 years. <br> Cary as early as in the 1940s, he bred the famous \"old blue\" late japonica rice varieties. The early 1950s, he created the first single-season record in more than rice per mu jin. After that, his collaboration with multidisciplinary experts, establish a comprehensive set of system of rice cultivation techniques, and creatively put forward the theory of Rice yellow black nursery diagnosis. In the 1960s, Cary comrades to invest more effort in agricultural technical guidance. His long-term extended stay in the countryside personally engage in high-yield rice boilerplate, also traveled all over the main rice growing regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, imparting technical demonstration operation, high-yield rice in a large area of &#8203;&#8203;intensive level and played a significant role. 1970s, Comrade Chen Yongkang commitment to study double-crop rice triple cropping hybrid rice yield of law and technology, and on the experimental field of operation personally designed and created three harvests per-mu yield of wheat, rice, rice more than three the jin the record. He also actively participated in the Taihu Lake area of &#8203;&#8203;agricultural modernization construction of the base of scientific experiments, and explore ways to modernize China&#39;s agriculture. <br> 1981 23, \"People&#39;s Daily\" published an interview with the newspaper reporter Yan Shigui written \"Cary&#39;s character,\" wrote: <br> a few days after a morning, I finally saw him . <br> patch and patch he wore a faded clothes, yellow shoes, socks not wear. Gray-haired, but very strong and healthy, is a rustic weather-beaten old farmer image. <br> hear it, he was not good at rhetoric, in particular, say the is often said of those cliches; but a talk in a high-yielding rice experience, gushing words reasonable, so you can not help but admire! <br> \"farming is a science, and science is to grasp the law. Presbyterian hometown of speaking in a thick the Songjiang accent said, we are talking about the growth of rice, and rice-growing soil, fertilizer, water, air, light, temperature and other natural conditions, is an objective existence, have their their respective laws. For these laws, people are not violated. If the contrary, we should be punished. Of course, not to say to us in the front of the law on the helpless; understanding of the law, grasp the law, according to the conditions of use of the law. The \"<br> speaking and talking, (L $ dj而.c身m) contact him from the episode: <br>\" I remember in 1958, I engage in a two-acre rice yield fields, leading comrades ask me to acres producing 20,000 pounds of high-yield index, worked out with 1,000 pounds per acre soybean meal used for basal measures. I think that the conditions at the time, 20,000 pounds per mu is impossible; 1,000 pounds per acre with soybean meal used for basal unnecessary eat three is not realistic, not only a waste, but also will become fertilizer damage. I did not accept, or engage in normal circumstances, the rice looks good. That was always went to the the Agrocybe said: I &#39;Lao Chen, you piece of field per mu assured 3,000 pounds. &#39;I always say:&#39; No, one thousand pounds. &#39;Later harvest indeed is one thousand pounds. The contrary, when a small number of people is not the customer view of conditions, try holding the attitude, resulting in soaring rice, 200 pounds an acre did not reach. \"<br> Cary Here paused, seemed to be somewhat serious:\" Of course, this is a thing of the past. But we can not forget. I often think that we engage in scientific farming, we must honestly and act according to science, scientific experience, do not cater to what babbling chaos to a pass, it is not called scientific. The \"<br> listening Cary talk reminds me of his colleagues. <br> Sunan three harvests have been controversies diverse. Academy of day in September 1980, a provincial party secretary, and asked to see the ridge of the experimental field of Cary triple cropping species of a few percent in the end good? Lao Chen replied: \"You can not talk about proportion. Speak proportion of mess you on across the board. Agricultural production big difference to a team is a team of investigators, conditional, suitable mobilization species; conditions is not enough to fall under that; really no conditions not species, raising the ground from reality. More and more of our national population, (l $ dj而.身r阱) do not grasp the food will not do. \"The secretary nodded:\" Your opinion is. \"<br>\" But now, in some places of scientific farming is not yet solid, there are a lot of problems. \"Lao Chen interrupted my meditation,\" Last year, I ran below, a county party secretary told me, some places still trickery, the output is not real, is adding up how this got? \"<br> This is really worth seriously. <br> maybe in some people&#39;s eyes, Cary is an outstanding model workers; However, I think that he is a true scientist! <br>'
