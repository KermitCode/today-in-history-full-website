'cont'=>'October 9, 1986 (Bingyin September sixth days), the former Soviet Union scientists uncover the mysteries of the tornado. <br> 1986, the former Soviet Union scientists unravel the mysteries of a tornado. <br> Moscow theoretical and experimental physics Institute scientists reveal the secret of the tornado, tornado damage scale can be compared with a nuclear explosion. They proposed the theory of gravitation - thermal processes within the tornado not only reveals the nature of this special atmosphere phenomenon, but also become the key to solve the power problem. <br> new theory authors, Technology Dr. Viktor Kushan identify the tornado is not, as previously thought as \"dust devil\", the funnel-shaped whirlpool spiral rain. Whirlpool internal rotation reach supersonic. According to the scientists calculated, when the whirlpool of two hundred meters in diameter, tornadoes swirling power of 30,000 MW, which is equivalent to the power of ten huge power station. Before <br> tornado form a cyclone, the cyclone is generated when the collision of the cold and hot atmospheric front. If the cyclone encountered on the way the plot has many rain lightning clouds, rivers and lakes, water cyclone Jibei taken away, into the rapidly swirling. According to the known laws of physics, thus formed the tornado funnel-shaped whirlpool rise cold upper atmosphere. Here, the water quickly freezes, thus releasing energy. The new view of the Soviet scientists to encourage people to consider the possibility of new power. <br>'
