'cont'=>'February 9, 1981 (, yau fifth day of the first month), China&#39;s first large-scale high-throughput atomic reactor built. the 9, <br> 1981 Southwest Reactor Engineering Design Institute of the Second Ministry of Machine Design China&#39;s first large-scale high-throughput atomic reactor built, and successfully carried out a high-power operation. <br> the reactor thermal power design quota of 125,000 kilowatts, the maximum thermal neutron flux is 620 trillion neutrons per square centimeter per second. <br> the reactor is a test reactor irradiation, with complete process experimental research tools and extensive engineering tests on the reactor facilities. It has \"a bunch of multi-use characteristics, can produce a variety of radioisotopes and toroidal elements, but also the technology research and production of trace element activation analysis and single crystal silicon neutron transmutation. Its main and supporting projects a total of more than 50,000 pieces of equipment, all manufactured by our own. <br>'
