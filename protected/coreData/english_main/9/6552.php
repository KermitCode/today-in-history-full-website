'cont'=>'(JiMao May 26), July 9, 1999, Lee Teng-hui&#39;s \"two states theory\" is thrown. <br> In July 1999, Lee Teng-hui in an interview with a foreign radio station, openly, the Taiwan authorities have sent strait relations as \"state to state, or at least special country with State relations. \" The person in charge of some aspects of the Taiwan authorities also said that cross-strait relations from the \"two equal political entities\" walked \"two countries\", the cross-strait talks is \"state-to-state talks. On July 11, the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman made the conversation. The following is the full text: <br> Lee Teng-hui openly distort cross-strait relations as \"state-to-state relations\", once again exposed his usual deliberate splitting China&#39;s territory and sovereignty, the political nature of the vain attempt to split Taiwan from China, and The advocates of the \"Taiwan independence\" separatist forces colluded farther and farther on the road of splitting the motherland. Lee Teng-hui&#39;s own words and actions prove that he has repeatedly said that \"we will not also not necessary to adopt the &#39;Taiwan independence&#39; line\", and did not give up the pursuit of the goal of reunification in the future, Taiwan compatriots and the international public opinion to deceive. <br> the world is only one China, and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, China&#39;s territory and sovereignty can not be divided. Although not yet reunification across the Taiwan Strait, but Taiwan is part of Chinese territory status has not changed, China has sovereignty over Taiwan has not changed. This is recognized by the majority of countries in the world. We are firmly opposed to any attempt to create \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities of \"two Chinas\", \"one China, one Taiwan\". <br> solve the Taiwan issue and realization of the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of the people, the general trend. Refused unified deliberately split, creating obstacles for the development of cross-strait relations, contrary to the will of the Chinese people, moving against the tide, unpopular, is doomed to failure. We solemnly warn the Taiwan separatist forces, stop now, to give up playing with fire action, stop all separatist activities. We will continue, together with the majority of Taiwan compatriots, the comprehensive development of cross-strait relations, and promote the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland. <br> evaluation: Contemporary Wang Jingwei, put this on record <br>'
