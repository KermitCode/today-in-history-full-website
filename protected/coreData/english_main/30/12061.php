'cont'=>'The (Horse winter months 27), December 30, 2002, China successfully launched the Shenzhou IV spacecraft. <br> Shenzhou IV unmanned spacecraft at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center Long March II F carrier rocket successfully emission launch <br> GMT early morning of December 30, 2002, the \"Shenzhou & rdquo ; fourth unmanned spacecraft was launched by a Long March II F carrier rocket at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. Beijing on the morning of December 30, 2002, developed by China&#39;s \"Shenzhou IV unmanned spacecraft at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center launch and successfully entered orbit. This is the fourth flight test of China&#39;s manned space project. The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress Chairman Li Peng, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier Wu Bangguo, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Jia Qinglin launch site to watch the launch of the spacecraft. In the early morning of the 30th, the manned space launch site brilliant starry sky. A height of 100 meters spacecraft next to the tower, stands the Long March II F bundled thrust carrier rocket, eye-catching \"of Shenjian\" word Comrade Jiang Zemin inscribed on the rocket body, the top of the rocket supports the weight of the Shenzhou & rdquo ; fourth spacecraft. 0:40, deafening loud noise, the rocket into the sky, moving rapidly into space, rocket tail long flames ejected designated under a beautiful rainbow in the night sky. Ten minutes later, the spacecraft successfully entered orbit. The launch was successful, marking China&#39;s manned space made new progress has taken an important step to achieve manned flight. After the successful launch of the spacecraft, Li Peng delivered an important speech. He said, we have lived through an exciting time, \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft remarkable successful launch. This is a long national ambition, the vibration the happy occasion of the national and military might, the whole country should be proud inspire. I represent Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin, Cao, Song Jian and other leaders expressed warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all scientific and technical personnel to participate in the development and testing of manned space engineering, cadres, workers and PLA officers. The launch is successful, the whole army and the people conscientiously study and implement the guiding principles of the congress, high-spirited and create a new situation in a great situation, \"Shenzhou III spacecraft was successfully launched only nine months time, Li Peng pointed out, Lane made very significant. This is a scientific decision-making of the CPC Central Committee, the result of the correct leadership, unity and cooperation of all participating personnel struggling. The successful launch marked China&#39;s manned space technology has matured and improved significantly, marking China&#39;s comprehensive national strength, scientific and technological strength, fully demonstrated the strong confidence of the Chinese people to unite as one to achieve the great rejuvenation of the nation. The launch was successful, not only for the development of China&#39;s manned space project is a huge boost, and are a great inspiration to all fronts. The practice proves once again that the CPC Central Committee and determined to engage in the decision-making of the manned spacecraft is very correct. We want to unswervingly in accordance with the established goals, and make due contributions to human development and utilization of space. Li stressed that the 16th CPC National Congress established a new goal for the development of our country, depicted the new grand blueprint. Manned space project is a national key projects. Vigorously promote the key engineering breakthroughs and the development of China&#39;s manned space technology for building a moderately prosperous society, and promote the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a significant and far-reaching impact. Honor in front of comrades, your hard work and sweat of the party and the people will never forget that your achievements will forever go down in history. The follow-up mission of the manned space project also heavy. I hope to participate in the development and testing of all the comrades, conscientiously study and implement the spirit of the 16th CPC National Congress, to fully implement the \"Three Represents\" important thought, vigorously carry forward the spirit of the \"two bombs and one satellite\" to maintain and carry forward the excellent space front traditional and tenacious style, make persistent efforts, the momentum, the meticulous work, insist on quality first manned flight test a complete success, the Chinese nation&#39;s dream of flying, to achieve the goal of the National Congress proposed to make greater contribution. The pre-launch of the \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft, Li Peng, Wu Bangguo, Jia Qinglin also heard reports on the work of manned spaceflight chief commander Li Jinai, the effects of the spacecraft transmitter front-line headquarters, command and control lobby rocket ship vertical assembly and testing plant met with the presence of the participating personnel and the manned space launch site, and cordially shook hands with everyone. China on November 20, 1999 for the first time the successful launch of \"Shenzhou\" spacecraft. Accordance with the development plan to launch several unmanned spacecraft, and then manned flight. The launch of \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft is an important flight test of the entire development program. The spacecraft will return to the ground after the space to complete the pre-test task. \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft developed mainly owned by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Academy of Space Technology and the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology; Long March II F rocket owned by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology developed. The relevant units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Information Industry and other departments, has been developed the shipboard instrumentation for space scientific experiments and applied research and ground-based monitoring equipment. Manned space applications system-wide to participate in the trial, the spacecraft will conduct a multi-modal microwave remote sensing to detect the autonomous flight of the space and stay in orbit during the flight, and integrated precision orbit determination tests, spatial separation of biological macromolecules and cell purification experiments, micro- gravity fluid physics experiments, space science and technology research projects. Astronaut system and the spacecraft environment control and life support subsystems are also fully participate in the trial. Previously, prepare astronauts have entered the spaceship actual experience. The test requirements in accordance with the formal manned flight, the establishment of a number of land-based emergency life-saving area and emergency rescue at sea zone, ambulance personnel are in place and on drills. Spacecraft in orbit during the flight, under the unified control of the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, about the monitoring stations and the \"Yuanwang\" ocean space tracking ship, the spacecraft will be continuous tracking, measurement and control. The launch of \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft, the 69th flight of the Long March series of carrier rockets, but also since October 1996, China&#39;s space launch second consecutive seventh succeed. Spacecraft launch site - the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, built a sound emission measurement, control, communication and command systems and adapt the equipment and facilities needed by the astronauts, as well as a backup landing site and emergency life-saving medical centers. <br> Caption: Beijing on the morning of December 30, 2002, the unmanned spacecraft \"Shenzhou IV in the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center Long March II F carrier rocket launch. The spacecraft entered orbit as planned. <br>'
