Masayuki word, Jiangxi high Anren training fully verify the Compton effect, and the development of the theory. <br> Wu Compton effect, also known as the \"Compton - Wu training effect\" the the important groundbreaking discovery of quantum mechanics. CommScope achievements of the theory after the Dayton effect is to verify Compton won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics. of Wu Youxun contribution to the X-ray scattering effect and quantum mechanics is not awarded the Nobel Prize, but he is recognized as the first in the world of modern science to make a significant contribution to Chinese scientists.

November 1925, the 135 th meeting of the American Physical Society in Wu convened laboratory training where, in exchange papers read at the meeting, Wu Xun papers energy distribution change lines in the Compton effect and unchanged line between \"ranked first after returning <br> training to establish China&#39;s first modern physics research experiments, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) Wu room, creating the Chinese physics research precedent (L $ dj而.c身m,) is called Chinese physics research Kaishanzushi <br> Wu training has long been engaged in education, has cultivated Wang Ganchang, [l $ dj而 the 身r阱] Sanqiang, chang (lsjt.net) Deng Jiaxian, Chen Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee, Feng Duan, a large number of well-known scientists. <br> 1935, he was the German Academy of Natural Sciences elected as Fellow of the first A Western countries to grant Chinese academician title. <br> Figure: Wu Xun old photos. <br> reviews: great scientist <br>,'
