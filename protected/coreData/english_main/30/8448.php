'cont'=>'August 30, 1852 (, Yam Tze July 16), born in the Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van Hoof. <br> <br> Jacobs Henricus van Hoof (Dutch: Jacobus by Henricus van &#39;t Hoff, 1852 August 30, 2011 -1911 years March 11 day), born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, died in Berlin, Germany, a Dutch chemist, in 1901 was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In In August 30, Sunrise, 1852 was born in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The father is a MD, Fan Tuofu childhood witty. High school, have a strong interest in chemical experiments. Often sneak in after school school lab doing chemistry experiments. Learn industrial technology from 1869 to the Higher Technical School of Delft, graduating with honors, and by the school to teach chemists AC Aode Mansfield and physicists Vander Sander Bak Hu, according to Yan attention. The 1872 van Hoof, graduated from the University of Leiden, at the Paris School of Medicine Wu hereby laboratory. <br> 1875 space Chemistry put forward the hypothesis of the spatial structure of the molecules, pioneered the concept of asymmetric carbon atoms, and the hypothesis of a positive carbon tetrahedral geometry (also known as Hoof - Le Bell model), i.e., a carbon atom connected to four different atoms or groups, initially solved the optically active substance with the structure of the relationship, the results of this study in the chemical sector immediately caused enormous repercussions, and is mixed; organic chemist Professor Leeson Yunus, salty wrote to van Hoof said: \"You in the theoretical aspects of research I am very pleased. In your article, I see not only extremely resourceful attempt the description so far not figure out the facts, and I also believe that such an attempt in the science ... has epoch-making significance. Leipzig, Germany Professor Hermann Colby, that: \"a Utrecht School of Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Fan Huofu not interested in the precise chemical research. Declared in his stereochemical said he thinks the most convenient is multiplied by the Pegasus he rented from the College of Veterinary Medicine, he found when he bravely fly to the pinnacle of Mount Parnassus chemical, atomic how self combined in cosmic space. \"Soon hired as the University of Amsterdam, lecturer, professor of chemistry in 1878 liters, a former chemistry department. <br> 1877, van Hoof, began to pay attention to the study of chemical kinetics and chemical affinity. In 1884, the publication of the chemical kinetics of the book. In 1885, he was elected as a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. 1886 van Hoof, based on experimental data the van Hoof law - osmotic pressure and concentration of the solution and the temperature is proportional to its proportionality constant is the constant R in the gas state equation. In August 1887, German scientist Wilhelm Ostwald co-founder of the Journal of Physical Chemistry. <br> 1901 found the solution of chemical kinetic law and the osmotic pressure of the law as well as the contribution of stereochemistry and chemical equilibrium theory \"to become a Nobel Prize in Chemistry obtained , after invited to visit the United States, Germany. His later years, tuberculosis, body weight loss, still tireless in research, died March 1, 1911 in the vicinity of Berlin&#39;s Steglitz. <br> Review: the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry <br>'
