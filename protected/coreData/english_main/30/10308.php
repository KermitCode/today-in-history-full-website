(1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> Qian Xuesen while studying in attendance with his father photo <br> 1934 was admitted to Tsinghua University, aircraft design professionals at public expense in America. <br> 1934-1935 years to Hangzhoujianqiao Aircraft Factory internship, went to Nanjing, Nanchang Air Force aircraft repair plant trainee last visit to Beijing Tsinghua University and visiting instructors WANG Shi-Cho-In 1935, Qian Xuesen U.S. Yusen boat ride away from Shanghai, the country with the ship of the U.S. students The Xu Zhilun summer Peregrine Tudor to the United States into the MIT Department of Aeronautics. <br> 1936 the Qian Xuesen transfer to the California Institute of Technology, began with the teachers and students of Professor Von Karman (von Karman) first after a close collaborator friendship Qian Xuesen participated in rocket research team led by Ma Linna, under the guidance of the Von Karman, to study the thermodynamics of the rocket engine problem with Malin Na, etc. with sounding rockets and long-range rocket problems, and participated in the same year, Several experimental rocket, Early American storable liquid propellant sounding rocket in 1945 as \"female corporal\" and \"Corporal\" missile development work. <br> 1937 In the fall introduced by Ma Linna Qian Sen participated in the study group when the California Institute of Marxism-Leninism, the group&#39;s secretary, have knowledge of Chemical Physics, assistant researcher the S Weiyinbaomu (Weinbaum). Xuesen and Feng <br> 1938 Carmen can be carried out in cooperation compression flow boundary layer, reveals that even if a movement of the thermal body with the external cold air in a flight Mach considerable temperature difference, the cooling of the object is still inverter for heating, which is due to the air is compressed, the temperature rose high and boundary layer heat transfer rate increases. Qian Xuesen and Von Karman given Mach number of this inverter formula work at the California Institute of Technology doctoral thesis was completed in June <br> 1939 The four high-speed aerodynamic research papers, obtaining a doctorate in aviation and mathematics, he served as an assistant researcher of the California Institute of Technology Department of Aeronautics same year, Qian Xuesen published research on compressible liquid two subsonic flow As a result, in 1941, Von Karman published research on aerodynamics Squeezing. role of compression on the wing, they jointly proposed a more general amendment without disturbance is very small this assumption, and based on the result of their amended another linear, so that it can be applied to high-speed flow, especially the forces applied to calculate the forces acting on the airfoil Carmen Qian Xuesen method can give satisfactory results within a speed range of the flow equations . <br> 1940 due to the the king help of recommended, Qian Xuesen Chengdu Institute of Aeronautics communication researcher, wrote an article entitled \"The high-speed airflow mutation of determination monograph, published in the second number of the report from 1940, Qian Xuesen and Von Karman cooperation, the study of the theory of nonlinear buckling on aircraft metal shell structure made a series of achievements, including the buckling of a spherical shell of external pressure, the curvature of the structure buckling characteristics impact, buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression, lateral nonlinear support column buckling, as well as the curvature of the shell buckling load. <br> 1941 from Canada to several Boxer Indemnity students: Guo Yonghuai, Lin Jiaqiao, Fu CY, again in 1942 Weichang, Qian Xuesen, close and they get along, often together to discuss various issues. <br> 1942 Qian Xuesen&#39;s research work has been achieved, and teach some of the students, while temporarily relax the restrictions on foreigners due to the needs of the U.S. wartime military scientific research, he was able to participate in the work of confidentiality in the same year, the U.S. military commissioned held at the California Institute of Technology Jet Technology Training Course (? v history today?? com) Qian Xuesen, a teacher. <br> 1944 U.S. Army that Germany developed the V-2 rocket intelligence, then entrusted the Professor Feng Kamen leadership, horse Lingner as vice vigorously study the long-range rocket. primitive type \"Corporal\" missile design, Qian Xuesen in charge of the theory group, Lin Jiaqiao the chang are also invited, ballistics analysis, combustion chamber heat conduction and combustion theory research. Qian also when Aerojet Corporation (Aerojet Company) technical adviser. <br> 1945 when Von Karman was hired by the Air Force Scientific Advisory regiment when he nominated Qian Xuesen members in May of the same year, the Second World War on the eve of (lssjt.cn) Qian Xuesen with the scientific advisory group to go to Europe to study in Britain, Germany, France and other countries aeronautics research, especially in the development of rocket technology in France and Germany Professor Feng Kamen, when Caltech elevate him as an associate professor. During this period, he made valuable experience in Modern Mechanics and Jet Propulsion scientific research become outstanding scientists prestigious. <br> 1946 summer to resign due to differences with the California Institute of Technology authorities, as Von Karman students, Qian Xuesen also left the California Institute of Technology, to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology associate professor, designed to teach aerodynamics graduate students in the same year rarefied gas physical, chemical and mechanical properties of combined research, this pioneering work. same year and Guo Yonghuai cooperation, \"dimensional compressible Asia, supersonic mixing flow and upper critical Mach number to complete the important papers, was first introduced in transonic flow problems concept of the upper and lower critical Mach number. <br> 1947 the beginning of the year, 36-year-old Qian Xuesen into the ranks of full professor of the Massachusetts Institute of young in summer, (history today www.lssdjt.com) Qian Xuesen to Massachusetts The college authorities leave to visit home in mid-September and married Jiang Ying Qian and Jiang Ying <br> 1947 wedding photos in Shanghai <br> 1948 the Fatherland Liberation career victory in sight, Qian Xuesen began to prepare to return home, he was required to withdraw from the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Group <br> 1949, Qian Xuesen receive an associate professor in the Institute of Metal Research, University of Chicago researcher, studied in the U.S. Chinese scientists Association of the United States District responsible for Ge court flint to write a letter, (l $ dj而.身r阱) turn to Professor Cao Richang May 14, 1949 letter addressed to Qian Xuesen, the Qian Xuesen more stepped up back to the motherland preparation. <br> 1949 In the fall Qian Xuesen returned to the California Institute of Technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology office Jet Propulsion technology professor <br> in 1950, the U.S. government decided to cancel Qian Xuesen&#39;s eligibility to participate in confidential research grounds that he was a friend and Weiyinbaomu relationship, and accused of Qian Xuesen, the American Communist Party members, and illegal immigrants. the Qian Xuesen Then immediately decided to return home to visit relatives in the name ready gone, but when his family will be starting (history www.TodayOnHistory com) Qian Xuesen detained up two weeks later colleague bail out, but continue to be subject to immigration restrictions and the FBI spy monitoring, is stranded five years. <br> 1953 in the United States Government persecution Qian Xuesen years, in addition to teaching and doing research work, academic research has not given up that year, he formally proposed the concept of the physical and mechanical advocate from the microscopic laws of the substance to determine its macro-mechanical characteristics, and the development of high temperature and pressure new areas. <br> in 1954 with groundbreaking research engineering cybernetics, \"a book published in the United States. <br> current June 1955 day, Qian Xuesen couple to get rid of the spy monitoring (history today TodayOnHistory.com) a write a small cigarette paper to send in the Belgian relatives home book, entrained in a letter to Mr. Chen Shutong request motherland to help him to an early return.
