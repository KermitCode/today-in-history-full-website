'cont'=>'August 30, 1871 (July 15), Xinwei, born in New Zealand physicist Rutherford. <br> Rutherford was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Rutherford born <br> Rutherford is one of New Zealand&#39;s greatest scientists, he can be called any era&#39;s greatest experimental physicist one of his career almost exactly vertical extension first great period of nuclear physics, he made many contributions to this field and long-term resident in the dominant position. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> Rutherford, 1871 years was born in Nelson, New Zealand on August 30, he is the fourth of 12 children, his education at the Christchurch School of Kan Bolei (lsjt.org) 1895 year scholarship to the University of Cambridge. [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] <br> Rutherford in New Zealand has made some work on the high-frequency magnetic field, he went to Cambridge under JJ Thomson guidance at first still engaged in the study, began research in 1896 & chi ; ray ionizing air conductivity. <br> 1898 he moved to Canada any professor at McGill University. there is a the Oxford culture chemist Frederick - Soddy most successful 18 months with him. cooperation during the period from October 1901 to April 1903, he published nine important papers, laid the foundation for the rigorous study of the radiology. <br> 1899 Rutherford&#39;s first important progress He proved that there are two totally different types of radiation, which he called alpha rays and beta rays the ¦Á ray transmission capacity is very small, but very ionization and ¦Â-ray the ¦Ö rays as transmission capacity, but small ionization ability. Rutherford and charges a 10-year effort to carefully experiment with a bold atomic Transmutation theory with Soddy (lssdjt.cn) <br> 1900 Rutherford pointed, and the third kind of radiation is not deflected in a magnetic field, a high-energy electromagnetic radiation, he said that such radiation as \"¦Ã-ray.\" <br> Rutherford also began to study radioactive element thorium, thorium addition to ¦Á, ¦Â, ¦Ã rays outside, also issued a radioactive gas, which he called \"emanation\" He pointed out that the emanation activities in terms of a specific speed attenuation lose half of the activity in a fixed period (half-life) Rutherford and Soddy began actively studying thorium compounds, that the presence of a more active substances thorium ¦Ö. they finally realized that the emanation thorium ¦Ö generated, while thorium ¦Ö from natural thorium generated In other words, the presence of a sequence in which a chemical element is changing (transmutation) for the other elements. <br> 1905, Rutherford and Soddy published their theory of transmutation sequence. Luther the blessing later published a book, called \"new alchemy\", Soddy continue this work, and eventually the introduction of the concept of the isotope. again attention to the <br> Rutherford radioactive decay launch & alpha ; radiation, Alpha radiation is a helium atom loses two electrons he moved to the University of Manchester, England, in 1907, continue to study alpha radiation. Geiger invented in 1908 in Manchester, Rutherford and Hans - Geiger counter is here, (l $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) cover leather and Ernest - Marsden in 1910, according to Rutherford&#39;s proposal to study the scattering of alpha particles through a thin metal foil, they used coated with zinc sulfide screen detect these particles, when high-energy particles hit the screen, on the issue of short flash (blink). <br> Geiger and Marsden found, the vast majority of particles through the gold foil only tiny deflection, but a very small proportion (about 8000 a) deflection great. Rutherford later describe this as the most amazing event in my life encountered .... it will hit you like you use a 15-inch artillery shells a tissue while shells bounced as incredible. \"In order to give an explanation for this result, Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in 1911 , pointed out that almost all the mass is concentrated in a small area, most of the area of &#8203;&#8203;the atoms are \"empty space\". nuclear atoms (Rutherford 1912 Nuclear terminology) He also proposed a theoretical formula shows that in different angle scattering by a nuclear particle number. nuclear atom concept Nepal Waals - Bohr&#39;s further development. <br> in the First World War in Rutherford with acoustic methods to detect submarines for the Navy service in 1919, after the war to England any Cavendish physics lectures, Professor and Director of the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. <br> 1919 in this experiment room, he made the third important finding - artificial nuclear transformation of an ¦Á-particle source. device in a cylinder filled with different gases in accordance with some of the early experiments of Marsden, at the end of the cylinder to open a small hole, is covered with a metal sheet, some of the atoms through the metal pieces to escape. cylindrical inner charged nitrogen, to produce the energetic particles, which is the hydrogen nucleus (i.e., protons) Rutherford noted that \"with the high-speed & alpha ; strong effect of particles generated in the head-on collision, a nitrogen atom metamorphosis, but released from the hydrogen atom constituting an integral part of the nitrogen nucleus. \"Rutherford successfully made the first transmutation. Rutherford with James - Chadwick went on to point out that from 1920 to 1924, in the ¦Á-particle bombardment, most of the lighter elements emitted protons. <br> Rutherford in various achievements in this field, in fact, created a an entirely new disciplines - nuclear physics. <br>'
