'cont'=>'August 30, 1940 (Gengchen July 27), the physicist JJ Thomson&#39;s death in Cambridge, England. \"target =\" _blank \"> <br> JJ Thomson in Cambridge, England, the death of the house of Thomson is concentrating on doing experiments <br> December 1856, Thomson was born near Manchester, England, 14 years of age to enter Owen &#39;s College, studying engineering and then learning science, and obtained a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. has been a member of the College after his graduation in 1876, held a variety of positions and their whole lives. presided in John - Raleigh the work of the Cavendish Laboratory in 1884 following the Rayleigh any professor of physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. <br> JJ Thomson&#39;s most brilliant scientific work is his research on cathode rays, and from the discovery of the electron. He a high vacuum discharge tube, and to adjust the electric field and the magnetic field caused by the deflection, the calculated rays speed determining the ratio of the charge e and the mass m of the cathode ray. Thomson & found that the charge to mass ratio of the cathode ray e / m, and a discharge tube in the type of gas and the cathode metal contents; about a thousand times smaller than the corresponding value of the already obtained electrolyte hydrogen ion. he later continue measuring the charge carried by the various anions, to find that the charge in the gas discharge and electrolysis of the charge is the same., he finally concluded that cathode rays are negatively charged particles, the elementary particles of matter, atoms is much smaller than the smallest known. This is the new concept of the atom, is the study of subatomic particles has opened the way for. In April 1897, Thomson announced the discovery of this entity that is smaller than that of the hydrogen atom. research <br> JJ Thomson later, including Eugene - Gold Stein (EugenGoldstein), pole tunnel ray, Thomson called cathode ray This study presents a new method, i.e. the cathode ray deflection can be separated from a variety of atoms and molecules in the magnetic and electric fields, use this approach, Thomson first determined isotope neon 22. Such an approach is Francis-W-Aston adopted, and later made a mass spectrometer In JJ Thomson in 1906 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. <br>'
