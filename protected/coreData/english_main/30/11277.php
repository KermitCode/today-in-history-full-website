At this point, affecting capital millions of public uproar, finally legal argument on the topic of \"dog\" right and wrong. <br> Kennel restricted area, Walking the dog time limit ... \"Beijing strict limit Kennel provisions\" clearly states: \"Municipality Kennel strict restrictions, strict management policy of total control. \"<br> The focus limit Kennel region, the outer suburbs and counties under the city, Dongcheng District, Xicheng, Chongwen, Xuanwu, Chaoyang District, Haidian District, Fengtai District, Shijingshan District, will be the general Limit Kennel region. The key limited support individuals raising of dogs, large dogs is strictly prohibited in the region. <br> the simultaneous implementation of the Kennel permit system, anyone Kennel are required to seek approval from the local police station in which they live. Kennel approved individuals, each household will only be allowed to take a kitten. <br> Kennel approved, must pay a registration fee and annual registration fee. The focus limited support each dog in the region first year registration fee of 5,000 yuan, after the annual registration fee of $ 2,000. Registration within three months from the date of the implementation of the provisions, a reduction in the registration fee of 2,000 yuan. <br> the Kennel people must bring dogs to the public security authority for registration and obtain a dog license and dog license, dog license required to register annually. <br> \"provisions\" also designated markets, shops, hotels, parks, public green spaces, schools, hospitals, exhibition halls, theaters, stadiums, playgrounds, railway stations, airports and other public places prohibited to bring dogs into addition to rental public transport outside of the car and lift dog who will refuse to ride. (L $ j而.c里) <br> the focus limit cultivation area, the dog Deto time is limited in the night from 20:00 to 7:00 the next day, and provisions must be tied to dog chain dog outdoors led by adults, collar, dog feces excretion outdoor bringing a dog should be removed immediately. The Kennel (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> must also regularly shot prevent rabies vaccine for concern. <br> \"provisions\" after the implementation of the dogs this former freedom, the arbitrary behavior will become a legally row behavior. In 17th, <br> 10 months, the Municipal People&#39;s Congress issued a notice, published in the \"Beijing Daily\" provisions (revised draft) \", to collect public opinion. <br> draft an announcement, dogs the amount of the registration fee immediately become the focal point of public calls, 65.7% of people believe that the charges are too high in the letter. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) <br> some grass-roots public security police and street office cadres also worried that the charges are too high will increase the difficulty of law enforcement, and may lead to some of the provisions of the regulations can not implement. <br> For these situations, the Municipal People&#39;s Congress and the Municipal Public Security Bureau jointly Kennel residents occupation and income survey. <br> based on a lot of research, the Municipal People&#39;s Congress modified in the provisions of the draft in the second draft of the dog registration fee and annual registration fee adjusted, not only to each dog, the registration fee is reduced to 5000 Yuan, the annual registration fee is reduced to 2000 yuan, but also on the registration within three months after the implementation of the prescribed Kennel households, a reduction in the registration fee of 2,000 yuan. <br> on the fourteenth meeting of the Tenth NPC Standing Committee held in the city on November 29, the members and nonvoting representatives on the provisions (revision of the draft second draft) \"were considered. Most people think of the new \"dog price &#39;in line with the city of love, easy to law enforcement. <br> Shi Hongfei representative said that we were one-sided that the dogs are wealthy, rich star, so I hope to reach a limited support role by the method of high charges, through the investigation, we found that most people in the Kennel working-class, \"low charges, strict management, heavy penalties\" is more feasible. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> 10th Standing Committee member Li Wang said, I insist that the original dog registration fee of 6,000 yuan a can not be less, but the findings are dogs mostly working-class, and so I think to have kept a dog registration may be relaxed, conducive to the implementation. the <br> history given the influx of members not agree to a reduction in the registration fee of 2,000 yuan dog household registration within three months. The history of members not raise during the municipal government under the 8 dogs was illegal, their preferential deals illegal, so should not be less. the <br> Cheng Xiaoxia members do not agree with preferential illegal saying she thinks now dogs violations caused by lax enforcement, and the purpose of the legislation is not punishment, so this offer is neither reasonable, and easy to the future of law enforcement work, help to promote the implementation of the regulations. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> strictly limited to the promulgation of regulations to keep dogs, some Standing Committee members think this is a big move for Beijing administering the City. the <br> In fact, Beijing early in 1982 have had on the \"Eight does not support\" when the Sanitation Bureau organized a dog team, and carry a big stick, the noose, the streets turn to see a dog hit . But soon, \"eight do not support\" will be forgotten. <br> the past two years, the capital suddenly have nearly 100,000 large and small dogs, the streets everywhere a dog dog Shadow, the dog wounding disturbing things always happen, dog this faithful animal start people hate. <br> Municipal People&#39;s Congress early this year, 476 delegates to ban dog, the motion limit dog and recommendations, many people have seen now Takao complexity. In August this year, the Municipal People&#39;s Government has drafted a strictly limited the Kennel provisions (draft), Beijing Municipal People&#39;s Congress after a preliminary review released a revised draft to the public for comments. <br> a short period of over 20 days, the city held a total of the forum 5452, more than 154,000 people participated in the discussion, the Municipal People&#39;s Congress, the Municipal People&#39;s Government has also received letters from the public, caller 7269. <br> widely for comments, in the spirit of respect for the wishes of the majority of the public, at the same time to take care of the reasonable demands of the minority public principle, the Municipal People&#39;s Congress again revised provisions (revised draft). <br> is no absolute freedom in the world, so the dog. Only in accordance with the law Kennel dog this loyal famous animal might actually become a human pet. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br>'
