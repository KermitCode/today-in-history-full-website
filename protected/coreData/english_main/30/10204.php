'cont'=>'(, Kang Xi September tenth day), October 30, 1979, the U.S. scientists for the first time measured the interstellar space antimatter stream. The picture shows our <br> explore antimatter and dark matter the magnetic spectrometer <br> 1979 October 30, 2010, U.S. scientists recently using high-altitude balloons measured antimatter flow of interstellar space. This is the first discovered antimatter outside laboratories on Earth. New Mexico State University <br> American science researchers recently the 60th floor of a large helium-filled balloon on the altitude of 35 km. The balloon is mounted on a 5000 pounds by weight of the high sensitivity of scientific exploration equipment, including a 300 pounds by weight of low-temperature superconducting magnets. Balloon flight eight hours at high altitude, its magnetic field detector measured was 28 antiprotons. the <br> Scientists believe that this discovery research will have an important impact on the origin of the universe. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> According to reports, the science of the study of elementary particles concluded decades ago, a normal particles may have a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge exists. With electronegative electronic anti-electron, with electropositive and electronegative of antiproton proton has a positive charge. Moreover, in laboratory tests, the collision of the matter and antimatter, both particles disappear and produce energy and new particles. One of the confusing <br> modern astronomy and cosmology in space, apparently did not find the antimatter. A theory of the universe that the formation of an equal number of matter and antimatter in the universe founding, he. In order to explain why there is no antimatter in space, some astronomers believe that this significant discovery since the universe founding to the present, the antimatter decay Scots Jingmei Guo scientists, due to the inherent instability of antimatter, rejected this interpretation, it as the main form of antimatter antiprotons are stable, and there can be millions of years. <br>'
