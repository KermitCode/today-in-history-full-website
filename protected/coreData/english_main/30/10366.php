'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'October 30, 1961 (September 21, 1901), the Soviet Union was the world&#39;s largest nuclear test. <br> the Soviet Union&#39;s first atomic bomb, with super hydrogen bomb shape like In May 1960, Bowles driving an American U-2 spy plane in the Soviet Union Las Calder the near Love Trask was shot down over, after Khrushchev said more than once \"to give the U.S. point of severe look. This period. The equivalent of 100 million tons of TNT Super The development of the hydrogen bomb in the end of the Arzamas-16 top-secret laboratory. Than Hiroshima, Japan in 1945 when large U.S. atomic bomb razed to the ground 10,000 times. If this is a super hydrogen bomb explosion in Moscow over (on www.TodayOnHistory.com) Moscow will disappear from the earth. To vote in New York, New York, together with its Zuozuo skyscrapers will be reduced to ashes. Hiding deep below the subway is also difficult to survive. Because of all the entrances and exits of the subway will be flames melted. Also doomed city less than 700 km away from the center of the explosion. For example, Russian Tula Bu or Philadelphia will all destroyed, Kursk, St. Petersburg, or Boston, the majority of destroyed. We know this is super hydrogen bomb. <br> 1961 Super Soviet hydrogen bomb summer has been made, the rest is just test problems. The final decision explosions at the Novaya Zemlya test site. Occupied the Novaya Zemlya test site area of &#8203;&#8203;82,600 square km. <br> 1961 10 to 30 hydrogen bomb stuffed into the Tu-95 strategic bombers. The main problem is that the bombers how to leave the kill zone in a timely manner before the hydrogen bomb explosion. Hydrogen bomb exploded at an altitude of 4.5 km, is cast in Figure -95 able to climb up to a height of 15 km above the ground. The three landed almost almost simultaneously open. Crew can take advantage of 17 minutes before the hydrogen bomb explosion. -95 Fastest speed (subsonic) to leave the bomb location and flying out of 250 kilometers before the hydrogen bomb explosion. Issued after the explosion of dazzling red light piercing the cockpit. Fortunately, the crew prior to wear sunglasses. Aircraft maneuvering camel continue the escape, but the shock wave oncoming faster. It on aircraft while throwing, throwing for a while. Behind the formation of the Novaya Zemlya residents who have not seen the mushroom cloud is frozen with fear. Rapid expansion and spiraling, straight into the atmosphere. Museum in Arzamas-16, a record of the explosion scenario news documentary. This documentary has not the same audience. at the site of the explosion of three meters thick, 15-20 km in diameter <br> ice is melting. People hiding in the basement of 2OO km away to participate in the trial, so they feel like Britain, they heard a powerful cry muffled frightening appalled that the end of the world. Fortifications on the explosion test conducted disappear without a trace. Tank turrets were destroyed, lying on the ground with a bent or destroyed housing disorder. The explosion the ground also placed the animals used for testing, but the person responsible for testing could not bear to talk about their scene. <br> world knows Novaya Zemlya happening, super hydrogen bomb explosion concealed from the people, have a record of all the seismic stations. Khrushchev explosion results satisfied. He said in a speech: \"We also have equivalent larger hydrogen bomb, but we do not want to be tested, because we are worried that the home&#39;s windows will be Zhenfei. \"From a military perspective, making such a big power of the hydrogen bomb is difficult to make people understand, it only makes the earth was drowned. But this victory Who needs it? Arzamas-16 laboratory also developed the equivalent of 1 billion tons of TNT, the hydrogen bomb. If such a hydrogen bomb explosion, caused by the tsunami waves of up to 1 km will diffuse through the entire American continent, to \"imperialist fortress destroyed forever. <br>'
