'cont'=>'April 30, 1777 (March 23), Ding, German mathematician Gauss&#39;s birthday. which <br> famous mathematician of the ancient and modern, like Gauss&#39;s Birthday \"target =\" _blank \"> Gaussian as childhood highly mathematical talent, I am afraid, is extremely rare. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) < br> Gaussian born in a peasant family in Germany in April 1777 Sunrise He grew fond of mathematics, said that when he under three, one day, he watched his father afterwards, after the end of the calculation, the father read out the money ready to write down the number, came around the small voice: \"Dad, miscalculated, and the total number is ......\" father surprised than complex calculation results, found the child&#39;s answer is correct. (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) Gaussian elementary school, once the teacher out of a problem, they add up from 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 ...... has been added to 100, thought that this Zhunneng students stumped. Gaussian for a while even if I did not expect out. teacher saw A number is 5050, that&#39;s right, by surprise. (Lssdjt.com) Gaussian count: 1 100,2 99,3 and 98 & hellip ; ... each pair and are 101, 100 less than this number a total of 50 pairs, 101 x 50 = 5050 This calculation method, algebra called arithmetic progression summation formula. then Gaussian was 10 years old. <br> Gaussian of interest in mathematics and more concentrated, mathematical theorems, formulas and confirmation methods one after another one he found and confirmed <br> 11 years old, he found that the (X + Y) n expansion. <br> 17 years of age, he found that the number of quadratic reciprocity law. <br> 1796 30, only 18 years old, Gaussian, there has been a worthy said the most amazing discovery of the history of mathematics, he used algebraic methods to solve geometric problems in the past two thousand years, but found a circle using only ruler and compass, also known as the 17-gon ruler compass painting inscribed is 17-gon In order to commemorate the most important discovery in his youth, Gauss expressed the hope that the death in a regular 17-sided polygon can be engraved on his tombstone 1799, Gauss proved an important theorem: any equation of a Yuan Dynasty a root, this result mathematically known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, also called the Gauss theorem 1801, Gauss published his \"arithmetic Proceedings (history today www.lssdjt the com) Gaussian in the 23-year-old when began to study astronomy, and resolve the method of measuring the elliptical orbit of the planet, also known as the elliptic functions. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) <br> Gauss&#39;s achievements, on the one hand, from the talent, the one hand, from the diligence of his family was poor, the winter, the father in order to save kerosene, eating dinner asked him to go to bed, Gaussian own a lamp engrossed in reading late into the night, in the faint light under the age of 15, he studied Newton, Euler, Lagrange mathematical works of the famous mathematician and mastered calculus theory. Gauss&#39;s success, not fall from the sky, but hard to learn to his scientific work above all else, his wife was very ill, Gauss is studying an esoteric mathematical problems. servant several times to call him: \"If you do not immediately past, he can not see her one last time!\" Gauss said: told her to wait until my past. \"Wu Wu went to visit his wife until his hand come to an end, this (lssjt.cn) <br> Gaussian is gifted, more studious, and finally become a famous mathematician, known as the \"Prince of Mathematics\" in the early morning of February 23, 1855, Gauss died in his sleep, aged 78 years. <br>'
