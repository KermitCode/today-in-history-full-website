(Lssjt.cn) <br> to prove Woodward guilty, start to be the cause of death from Matthew, but it is in this crucial issue, the medical profession has a different view. One view was that Matthew suffered the injury in the admission of a few hours ago, caused by violent shaking and head hit a hard object. Another view was that the cracks Matthew skull is not a new injury, for at least three weeks, and is in the process of gradually healing. Matthew do head surgery doctors remove a blood clot from his cranial cavity, which seems to prove the latter statement. The most authoritative conclusions should be made by a pathologist.

Accordingly, the Woodward verdict will become a free man. Both lawyers have filed an appeal. Woodward hometown ecstatic, Americans generally shocked. <br>'
