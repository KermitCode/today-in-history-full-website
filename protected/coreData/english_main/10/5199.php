'title'=>'The British steamship First use the SOS distress signal',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'June 10, 1909 (, Jiyou April 23), the British ship the first to use the SOS distress signal. <br> ship sailing in the vast ocean, fog, storms, icebergs, reefs, mechanical breakdowns, collided with other vessels, often, accidents will happen. Death to people approaching the \"SOS\" distress signal flying to the sea and air to pass in all directions. Upon receipt of a distress signal, near the boat rapidly heading for the crash site to rescue the victims. Many people think <br> \"SOS\" is an abbreviation of three English words. But exactly which three English words? Was considered the \"Save Our Souls\" (save us); been interpreted as \"Save Our Ship\" (save our ship) was speculated that the \"Send Our Succour\" (speed assistance); others understood as \"Suving Of Soul\" (life-saving) ...... Really different opinions. In fact, the original makers of the \"SOS\" this is not the meaning. SOS is a manifestation of otherwise method. 19,15,19 191,519 respectively, S, O, S, the order of the 26 letters of the alphabet. The reason is that the SOS distress signal is well known, when SOS will be exposed under extreme passive victims of help, so 191,519 is another obscure symbol of the transfer and expression of distress message. <br> things also dates back to the early 20th century. 1903 First International radio reported that the meeting was held in Berlin, eight maritime countries attended the meeting. Taking into account the rapid development of the maritime industry and the growing number of accidents at sea, the meeting proposed to determine the specialized ship killed the radio signal. \"SSSDDD\" It was suggested that the three letter \"S\" and three \"D\" as a distress signal, but the meeting this did not make a formal decision. (History com) shortly <br> after the British Marconi radio company announced as ship&#39;s distress signal \"CQD\". In fact, this is only in the European railway radio communications generally callsign \"CQ\" behind together with a letter \"D\". Sailors put \"CQD\" is interpreted as \"Come quick, danger\" (speed, danger). \"CQD\" signal just installed Marconi radio equipment used on the ship, so the signal is still can not be counted as the International Institute for the Unification of the distress signal. Moreover, the the CQD general call sign \"CQ\" Only one word, it is easy to confuse. <br> 1906, the second session of the International Radio Conference held in Berlin. The meeting decided to fix with a clearer, more accurate signal instead of \"CQD\". The representative of the United States as a distress signal with the international flag signal abbreviations abbreviation \"NC\". This program has not been adopted. Si Liya ratio of the representative of Germany - to an alco Wireless experts recommend \"SOE\" distress signals. Discussion in, (lssjt.cn), it was pointed out that this signal has a major drawback: the letter \"E\" in Morse code is a point that the entire signal \"SOE\" \"﹞ ﹞ ﹞ - - ﹞ \"distance keying and receive easily be misunderstood, or even completely incomprehensible. Although this program has not yet been passed, but it is for the participants to open ideas. Then, it was suggested to use an \"S\" instead of \"SOE\", \"E\", and that \"SOS\". , \"SOS\" in Morse code ﹞ ﹞ ﹞ --- ﹞ ﹞ ﹞ \". It is brief, accurate, continuous, rhythmic, easy keying and reading, and is also very easy to understand. In announcing the \"SOS\" <br> for the International Institute for the Unification of distress signals at the same time, the abolition of other signals, including the commonly used \"CQD\". But the \"SOS\" and not immediately used, telegraph operator who still prefer the \"CQD\", because most of them past work in the railway system, the habit of using the \"CQD\". August <br> 1909, the U.S. ship the \"Arap Howie\" tail shaft broken, unable to sail on to the nearby coast and passing ships keying signal \"SOS\". This is the first time you use this signal. Until April 1912 after the sinking of the \"Titanic\", \"SOS\" was widely used. <br> In addition there is one of the most important reasons, SOS three letters either from above or upside down to see all the SOS, shipwrecked on a desert island with waiting for help to put a big \"SOS\" when the aircraft overhead road, whether coming from which direction can immediately recognizable. (Lsjt.net) <br> In fact, SOS is the international Morse code rescue signal, not an abbreviation of the word. In view of the frequent occurrence of the shipwreck, and often can not be issued a distress signal and fastest rescue, resulting in great casualties and property losses, international wireless telegraphy Treaty Organization in 1908, it is determined to be the international universal shipwreck distress signal . No practical significance of these three-letter combinations, just because it codes ... --- ... (three dots, three dashes, then add three dots) in a telegram transmitter side easy issue, receiving the report, most recognizable codes. <br> in 1908, the international high seas difficult distress signal CQD. Three letters of no practical significance, though many people think it is Come Quickly, Danger (Come and dangerous!), An acronym. Although the 1908 Convention on International Radiotelegraph organization has clearly defined application SOS distress signal as a shipwreck, but CQD still in use. Titanic shipwreck occurred early, the reason why the other vessels and rescue organizations have not been able to promptly organize rescue, mainly because they do not understand the CQD distress signal the onboard transmitters issued by outdated. Until the entire vessel almost gone into the sea before the issue of the SOS distress signal, but the time who may be there so Huitianzhili, (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) save those innocent soul to the bottom of the sea is about to forever? < br>'
