'cont'=>'December 10, 1918 (the Wu Wu the winter early eight), Planck&#39;s discovery of quantum theory and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. In December 1918, <br> Max Planck, the great German physicist Max Planck, because he made the revolutionary nature of the energy found, was awarded the Connaught Bell Prize in Physics. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) In the 1990s, Planck university professor in Berlin, wants to understand why the existing formula for hot objects can not explain the occurrence of the phenomenon of thermal radiation. In 1900, he proposed a new theory for accurate description of thermal radiation, but only the introduction of a new concept, in order to explain this new theory. This new concept is hot, and all other forms of energy is not absolutely inseparable, on the contrary, is a small cluster forms out firing. Planck this cluster called \"quantum\". The term \"quantum\" comes from the Latin, meaning \"how much\". So rich revolutionary quantum theory, that the physics community for many years could not accept. Planck I of this idea doubts, so he used a few years time to seek an alternative theory, have failed. This theory is the work of physicists with achievements, acceptance, such as Albert Einstein, quantum theory to explain the phenomenon called the photoelectric effect, Niels Bohr the use of quantum theory in 1913, successfully developed a new method to describe the atomic structure. <br>'
