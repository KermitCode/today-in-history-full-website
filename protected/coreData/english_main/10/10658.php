Opinion, this is the ideal figure of the author, he is not only the Ming Dynasty poor farmers \"savior\" and the socialist era of the Chinese people and their cadres to learn from. <br> in order to shape their own hero, of carefully designed. The arrangement The appearance of the great master of the blue sky, with a nine scene in the whole scene. First two two plays, Hai have not played screenplay hesitate ink ground uppercase Xu government that once Doudao the Yan Song, when Prime Minister Xu Jie a retirement home, how to occupy the farmers&#39; land, robbing the daughter of bribery official poor peasants were killed Zhao Yushan, the legitimate farmers Hong Alan \"filled with grief and indignation call heaven\" in the court of law on the occasion of a paper emergency official documents brought Hai will make the days of the command of the 10th House governor, carried away the officials, such as smell sunny Perak, exclaimed, \"It will be what to do! \"Even\" runners \"shouting\" to come to the sea-blue sky, this can be incredible! The third scene Hai plain clothes play, and of arrangements for him face to listen to the heart such as fried \"and\" all the villagers how to use the most revered words pour out all sorts of hope on the sea-blue sky, praise he is \"justice official judicious detective\", \"word of mouth Ode full,\" U.S. political multiterminal \"... Although feudal society \"top to bottom are the official World\" rational no money do not go inside, but farmers Huyuan unanimous in the belief that \"sea blue sky\" this government is an exception, \"sea blue sky must for us. Lord! \"This Hongyuntuoyue approach is to make the audience feel strongly that the only Hairui can save farmers suffering. It shows \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" is not, as the author said, is to write what the internal struggles of the feudal ruling class 6, but do everything possible for our audience today to shape a hero to decide the fate of farmers. the <br> dramatic conflict around expand the paddy fields. Comrade Wu Han script \"changed the theme to remove tyrants, but in fact the miscarriage of justice from the accounting Tian,\" In addition to tyrants, \"claiming in the preamble, the\" miscarriage of justice, \"the action is around the retreat field \". Paddy fields to be written is \"to help poor farmers approach a ¢ß climax as dramatic conflict\" dismissed from office, is to strike on this matter in paddy fields. The mouth of the screenplay by villagers A \"special note:\" I are Alex tenant \"; want the audience to remember: write the play between poor peasants and Xu Jie and other town officials, poor official struggle, while Hai is totally on the tenant one side of Alex. Sea blue sky \"did not disappoint, took office on\" the people decide \", he is not only a curse\" high money lenders usurped Tian Barbara Babbitt encouraged farmers to \"complain\", but rather in the court of law There are of democratic grace to seek the views of complain elders were. Farmers request a refund by Alex and various town officials \"of land occupied by the\" great master disposes \"So Hai a Decree issued a proclamation, ordering various town officials, within ten days of the one should occupation of innocent civilians Tin production, shown with the return. \" Paddy fields after the sharp class contradictions suddenly does not work, all the villagers \"kowtow to the Hai Rui said:\" The great master people make decisions, the Jiangnan poor future had a good day!

Repeated publicity screenplay: \"miscarriage of justice re-vindication\" Hai determination to \"appease the resentment, should evil officials sweeps\", \"scheduled to be civilians today complain, no legal forgiveness heavy as a mountain. (On TodayOnHistory.com) \"action Hai sentenced the Huating magistrate Wangming chopped sin script sentenced Songjiang prefect the Li Ping degree\" dismissal imprisoned pending towards life \", sentenced Xu Jie son Xu Ying twist sin. Comrade Wu Han Hai \"in order not to let go dingy ...... no momentum,\" made up his mind, Xu Ying killed ¢à. , Hai Rui Dismissed from Office persuaded to leave, they become the hero of a rebel against the victory of the feudal dynasty. When the play was over, and Xu Ying, sentenced to death, Xu Jie collapsed down, the new governor of panic, hold high the great seal Hai, scores of birds, the mouth that \"a real man of indomitable spirit, thought:\" I Hairui won! \"Of the task of shaping their own heroes,\" victory \"is completed. appears the play of <br>, as a positive hero, only Hairui one. Farmers only negative innocence, pleaded to the great master \"great master and I make decisions\" child care, their own destiny to sea blue sky. In order to set off the the Hai Rui image how high for all feudal officials, other officials all appearances designed to be the bad guy. Hai&#39;s wife and family are also \"play it safe\" to send only his mother supported him. Hai alone a person, from the economic to the political, alone engage in a revolution. <br> After reading the play, people feel strongly: Comrade Wu Han shape this heroic image than in the past many of the feudal era praise Hairui opera novels are shaped high most. Comrade Wu Han specially write a historical note, the booklet in front of the script is still \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office skill\" in excerpts of a large number of historical data in an attempt to make people get the impression that: he is entirely based on historical facts to write the play; However, people still can not help but send this question: which the ruling class of feudal society, it really appeared like a hero? \"Sea blue sky\" is a figure of history that really Hairui the artistic process, Comrade Wu Han series out of thin air? <br> a false the Hai Rui <br> we are not historians However, based on the material we have seen, the class position the historical contradictions depicted in the play to deal with these contradictions and Hai, is a violation of the historical truth. The Hai Rui drama Comrade Wu Han fabrications in order to promote their own point of view. <br> Hai is the summer of 1569, to Wuqi ¡ð In the spring of this time, any Yingtian governor. At that time, the very sharp class contradictions and class struggle in the south country. Longqing years from Zhengde to Jiajing, with the landlord class with a variety of methods to plunder the peasants&#39; land, land concentration increasing, the exploitation of farmers by increasing weight. Ri Zhi Lu contained: \"People in Wuzhong, Tian tithe, man tenant of even nine. \"Description the Songjiang along the vast majority of land are landowners occupied. Gu Yanwu, although not specify the exact age of the materials we found, this estimate is in line after the mid-Ming Su, loose along the case. Land grabbing is the most powerful, relying on the political forces to expand \"huangzhuang\" royal landlords Group is part of bureaucratic landlords in the countryside, Xu Jie on possession of a lot of land, some said twenty-four mu, some say 40 million acres, roughly equivalent to today belong Songjiang County, Shanghai, one-third of the arable land, or half. Hai Huating town officials fields and houses as much as a servant of the public, Wang curse resentment and hate, he witnessed the intensification of the class struggle portrayal. The land concentrated accelerated farmers sharpening contradictions with the landlord class. Large number of bankrupt farmers flee, many land barren, no land man helpers \"(\" Huating County \"). Peasantry with the contradictions of the landlord class is the fundamental contradiction of the feudal society, the sharpening of the class struggle, is bound to affect the relationship of landlord class within the class. In the case of the land most of the possession for the landlord, bureaucratic continue to annexation of land, can not fail to object to the small and medium-sized landowners, as well as Qian farming \"wealthy\" or \"kulak\" (also called the \"farmers\") who, thus the internal contradictions of the landlord class also acute. Misprision of a large number of land do not pay taxes due to bureaucratic landlord exclusive exploitation fruit, feudal dynasty finances is very difficult, \"Tangcang Kui dried up\", part of the DPRK officials constantly requesting the search field, and seek to restrict \"huangzhuang \"and other Shoda, restrictions continue to mergers of small landlords Tamida.\" This caused a sharpening of the conflict between the government and opposition factions landlords Group. The annexation of land, one of the main methods of bureaucratic landlord by Hairui in the paddy fields oppose the so-called \"cast offer.\" There are two main <br> cast offer. A despotic landlord forces to bribe a relationship with Harada main henchman, Harada main fields \"offer\" to the loss of land, so that the original \"wealthy\", \"Xian Tian\" The henchman became steward of the land or the two landlords. Another small landlords, rich peasants, an individual or a small number of homesteaders in order to avoid serious corvee and taxes, send to their own field dedicated to the bureaucratic landlord. \"Ming Code provisions bureaucratic corvee tax relief privileges, according to the grade level of the the Tian operator in bureaucratic landlord&#39;s name, you can escape corvee. Bureaucratic landlord took the opportunity to escape corvee small landlords and rich peasants, homesteaders land usurped for himself. Since the land most of the landlords, rich peasants of bureaucratic landlords through the \"Presentation of the usurped land is the land of the small landlords and rich peasants ¢á. This is the nature of the matter. \"Haizhong mediated public biography describes:\" Yi Gu rich Noir nationality produced in scholar Ning being a commission tenant rent output, avoid large labor Dubbed the cast offer. Therefore disabilities lift a board Township, Noir cast offer is subject to the wealthy. And the literati, both Xie losing ground, they tend to fold into your violence mergers, of course. Is ho powerful people, depending on the fields and houses in the stools, the closing of Mogan not with. \"The rich\" are talking about here, of course, not poor farmers, they have no land to \"offer\"; \"losing ground\" in the local literati but to no political identity of the small landlords and rich peasants. \"Tamida\" continue to be a \"ho powerful bureaucratic landlord mergers, to achieve\" the closing of Mogan not the point. Not only seriously damaged the interests of the small landlords and rich peasants, has a serious impact on the financial income of the dynasty. <br> Because of this, Ruiyi to the the Song Jiang Huating area, local ZhuSheng member \"Sage\" of the town officials and even some of the \"House sheriff are found\" Kwan Sing \"against the of Xu Jie type of bureaucratic landlord merger and a huge amount of land against them to engage in\" Presentation of Town officials Sage \"Hai said:\" twenty years since the government magistrate listen to town officials cite supervisor told his thing, fading people&#39;s property, town officials getting rich \". After eight characters are not alive draw large bureaucratic landlord annexation of small and medium-sized landowners a picture of it? The Hai Rui conclusion: \"merciless, people with anger ¢â,\" with anger \", refers to the small and medium-sized landlords, rich peasants, and intellectuals represent their interests common political attitude of the big landlords and mergers. When Dai Fengxiang Jiangnan large landowners spokesperson attack Hai connivance \"Diao Acts, Hai with the above material to prove his paddy fields in the voices of these people is based. It seems Hai, then fit the facts. His paddy fields, reflecting the people&#39;s property and fading small landlords and rich peasants common requirements, and also in order to ease the internal contradictions of the landlord class and the broad masses of peasants increasingly sharp class between the same landlord class contradiction conducive to increased tax revenues, to solve the financial difficulties of the court. after <br> figure out these historical facts, \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" How distorted class relations, it is clearly a. <br> Hai To town officials from paddy fields to the landlord to return the land to the farmers? Not. \"Ming Dynasty\" and several Hai Biography states the Hai requires town officials paddy fields to the exit \"by offering land. Public and harsh to governance, ordered by offering refund information, perhaps redemption. \"This is weakening the merger, the fight against large landowners. In addition to the beyond refunded official, make way Tian, &#8203;&#8203;most or fall on the original \"Xian Tian\" and \"weak\", \"well-off\" that small landlords and rich peasants in the hands, in fact, to protect the small and medium-sized the interests of landlords and rich peasants. Poor peasants neither field can offer, no money to go to \"redeem\" the paddy fields retreated to their hands, \"Of course not. How to concoct a Hairui is wholeheartedly for the poor farmers access to land and \"fighting\"? <br> Hai To Xu Jie paddy fields to \"Alex tenant turn over this? Simply nothing to do. Hai To Xu Jie paddy fields purposes described in the letter to Chun-Fang Li: \"If the rebate of more than half, and the people Diao insurance, the availability of only the yeah! Of heartless, to the detriment, for after the car of the Ring. ...... A mere desire to save Weng the retreat produced more than half of this public hundred years later was quiet meter also Xingwu that surprised. \"This is not the class position of the Hai It is plain do not you? Obviously \"ended\" folk \"Diao insurance for the landlord class will not be overthrown in increasingly sharp class struggle, to Xu Jie\" A century later, the quiet \", where solicit poor peasants views and solve the problem of the \"Alex tenant land! <br> Hai engage in paddy fields is people make decisions? Hai own governors Treaty tells us: him when the governor of all the measures are in addition to long-standing abuse in the peace and quiet complex ancestors&#39; became law. The original \"ancestors\" develop \"Ming Code\" already provides that: \"the interpleader and others land and make any rash has the hazy cast offer official ho potential to recipients rod hundred, Acts years. \"¢Ù ¢Ù errors Hai handled contradiction? Ming Dynasty long legal provisions of anti voted offered to ease the internal contradictions of the class, to prevent mergers vicious development to facilitate the consolidation of the landlord class dictatorship. This law and later became a dead letter. Hai However engage in this range anti Presentation of only, (TodayinHistory.cn) how can he write to become farmers Jiangnan \"disposes\"? <br> Hai opposed to \"poor farmers\" high money lenders \"? Best listen Hai refute Dai Fengxiang attack him: \"the first year Liangzhang often received food, the first addition also their daily private debt, after the operator of the official number; Regal also multiply the meter when the servo force debt repayment , public and private simultaneously Qianliang difficult to finish. The the minister ...... that be taxlord, the parties privately take subordinated non ban allowed debt also. \"Public\" feudal dynasty; \"private landlords and local tyrants. Hai he does not oppose the landlord exploitation of the countryside, is not opposed to \"money lenders\" just pocketed the exploitation of large landowners oppose countryside in order to solve the problem of fiscal revenue in Dynasty fruit. <br> Hai never want to fundamentally solve the conflict between farmers with landowners. He just wanted to ease this conflict. Hai said: \"following offer, meaning essential, whom the profit and loss mediator, so that may be a long time line. Frankly he has done is the work of the profit and loss mediator \"The aim is to limit the exploitation of large landowners without prejudice to the fundamental interests of the landlord class within the statutory range weaken the resistance of the peasants, make the following offer & rdquo ; feudal exploitation \"long line.\" He me constantly want farmers to obey the feudal rule compliance FELL, \"not as strong thief\", he advocated a two-pronged approach of peasant uprisings, the use of troops Anmin, go hand in hand. His opposition to the most reactionary of large landowners, the intention is not to undermine the landlord&#39;s land ownership, but to consolidate the land ownership of the landlord, the consolidation of the rule of the landlords and the peasants, and the consolidation of the regime of the Ming Dynasty. This is where the various groups of the feudal ruling class and the common interests of the various factions, the landlord class, the long-term interests of. Hai written as representative of the interests of farmers, confuse the enemy, denied the nature of the dictatorship of the landlord class, to beautify the landlord class. Hai has repeatedly shown himself loyal to the emperor, he dwelt on the fact that in a letter to the high arch his inner said: \"mere commitment and dedication, he tried to Jiangnan Li thousand centennial, remuneration En reported confidant also. \"How can he be able to make things shaken\" thousands of years of possession \"to it? the <br> Description of paddy fields is false. Level miscarriage of justice \"in the description is that true? According to the information we found, you can only make a negative answer. Songjiang prefect, Huating magistrate did not killed, and was banished. Day the Hai Rui any should governor, Su, Pine area have not removed any more than one county official. Xu Jie&#39;s son did not die, he was sentenced to exile. It is not Hairui dry, but Xu Jie Baxiang after, Xu Jie political opponents Gaogong renewed when dry, Jang came to power, the verdict is canceled. \"The Ming History ¡¤ Gaogong Biographies is written like this:\" order the children quite cross the village, the arch before prefect Cai Guoxi Supervision Department of the book recorded its philosophers, are compiled Shu, so brief order without exception to. Catch arch bit, trusted by solution. \"Xu Jie Biography\" in the same record. Grasping of Xu Jie son nature Gaogong opportunity retaliation, the executor is another bureaucracy with Hai irrelevant. Yan Song collapsed, Xu Jie Gong, Jang had a long-term struggle to seize power. Different political groups in the Cabinet strife, hard to move Hai who becomes Hai \"standing poor farmers aside\" to appease the resentment of \"This is not a violation of the basic historical facts? Comrade Wu Han knew the history, \"Xu Jie son was only sentenced to exile, but in order to write strongly beautify Hai Rui, still, in order to shape their own ideal hero, he was willing to rewrite the history of <br> Hai is not like the play is written as \"democratic\". On the contrary, he thinks Jiangnan folk Diao pseudo hundred end frame framed cover is nothing more than a ten-like and nine. His self-made way to deal with \"Diao First Instance taste without a break seven or eight people in the Yamen before exhibition in the stocks, and the first beat the folder of suffering\" that this is a good experience. Hai reforms and Regulations it comes to to suspect prison Shihai said: \"things in contention words Maung their Qu Xianghuan, Ning Qu Xiaomin, in order to save the body also. Small note saying: \"\" Xianghuan Xiaomin equal status of the other, the the Gu Yue deposit body. \"For the protection of the\" equal status of the other \"Ning Qu Xiaomin,\" This is the the landlord class dictatorship of the reactionary nature of the performance. Hard to say now how democracy Hai, or even request \"advice to farmers, this is not the political position of the Hai Rui reversed! <br> take a look at these historical facts, take a look at the \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" Hai, it is not difficult to find, this is a concocted false Hai Rui. This is a transformation of the bourgeois viewpoint characters. The the historical drama requires artistic process, need to create, we are not required to detail with the history of the new historical operas, but must request in line with historical truth in the character&#39;s class position and class relations. Comrade Wu Han once said historical drama to \"strive to achieve more in line with historical truth, impermissible distort fabrications\" ¢Ù The ¢Ú The, however, speak louder than words, this new history drama Hai Rui image has the same rational imagination and typical generalization does not What is the relationship can only belong to the scope \"distorted fabrications\" and \"Jiegufengjin. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> process of class struggle told us: Hai or Hai after feudal officials are not so decadent Ming Dynasty restore youthful, more implacable farmers flames of hatred. Hai, after the Songjiang farmers is still suffering from the the numerous brutal oppression and exploitation, mergers, fleeing the continued development of class contradictions remain acute. The 1587 the Hai Rui dead, after the peasant uprising the surging, potential like an angry tide. Ming Dynasty in 1644, away from the Hai died less than six decades. In front of such historical reality, the script turned out to be poor peasants sing the \"land need to worry that the clothing and meals, good times in front of the paddy fields! \"Cheers\" Jiangnan the poor Since then there had a good day! \"It is not absurd to ridiculous? <br> \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" aired what? <br> Now that is a false Hai Rui, we take a look of what aired through the artistic image. <br> We know that the state is a tool of class struggle, is a another class of class oppression authorities. There are no non-class, ultra-class country. This is the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism towards national issues. From this point of view, we can not but admit that feudal state to impose the dictatorship of the landlord class of farmers tool. Feudal state law, the court and the execution of the ruling powers of officials, including the \"clean government\", \"official\", can only be a tool of the dictatorship of the landlord class, but could never supraclass never be both for the ruling class is the ruling class service tools. Of course, since the landlord class that exist within the various strata and the Group, due to changes in the situation of the class struggle between them in this or that issue, in the treatment of the attitude of the big landlords, small landlords and rich peasants interests, degree of oppression farmers and method, there will be differences, struggle. However, fundamentally speaking, the essence of this struggle could never go beyond the maintenance of the dictatorship of the landlord class range. At any time, we are not able to distort the internal struggle of the landlord class into a class struggle between farmers with landowners. Take the \"clean government\" struggle with the \"corrupt\", does have a great master of honest and upright official in the court of the landlord class, according to certain provisions of the law of the landlord class, the punishment of some of the \"corrupt\" thing; individual farmers accuse happens to be one of the opposing faction or group in a \"clean government\", \"winning\" a lawsuit of individual farmers in front of the \"clean government\" thing. This phenomenon confuse a lot of farmers do not have the experience of political struggle, so they can not see the face of \"clean government\" class, see the class nature of the feudal state and feudal court, the landlord class often use this phenomenon to paralysis the consciousness of the peasants, \"clean government\" as tools to cover up the nature of class domination, as with armed repression, the class struggle of the peasants. \"Ming Dynasty\" recorded landlord class to send a \"clean government\" as a delaying tactic, the uprising of farmers in one fell swoop the eradication of things ¢Ù and ¢Ú. However, fundamentally speaking, regardless of \"clean government\", \"official\" how \"clear\" how much \"good\", they are, after all, only the landlord class dictatorship to farmers Officials & rdquo ;, \"official\", and never be the opposite. <br> \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" but we say: No! \"Clean government\" is not the tool of the dictatorship of the landlord class, but for the peasant class service. You see, the play Hai is a feudal dynasty imperial envoys, but he did not represent the interests of the poor peasants to expand Xu Jie violent struggle. In this struggle, on the one hand, \"clean government\" Hai to protect Alex tenant \"and the interests of all poor farmers hero appears, as opposed to other officials with all the implementation of the dictatorship of the landlord class,\" The contradiction between the clean government \"and\" corrupt \"was badly written as to protect farmers and repression of peasants contradiction, refund of farmers &#39;land and the seizure of farmers&#39; land of contradictions, and did not see a\" clean government \"in the consolidation of the landlord class dictatorship role. On the other hand, all farmers are written in passive inaction, there is no little spirit of revolutionary struggle, their only role is to kneel down and complain to the sea-blue sky \"and begged the great master of the blue sky for their cause, disposes,\" honest and upright official \"as is their savior. Obviously, \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" of the class struggle is not to push history forward momentum, \"clean government\" is to promote the power of history; masses do not need to own up to the liberation of their own, as long as the wait for a certain clean government \"the gift of the great master immediately to get the\" good old days \". In this way, the play put as the dictatorship of the tools of the landlord class \"clean government\" and the law, the court, all beautification became leaving the landlord class dictatorship of the independent existence of the super-class of things to promote the revolution of the oppressed people do not need to, do not need After any serious struggle, there is no need to destroy the old state machinery, \"no justice\" groveling to the \"clean government\" kowtow, the implementation of a feudal dynasty, wiped out corrupt officials will be able to be able to seek to better things. <br> Lenin said: national problem, this is a broken bourgeois scholars, writers and philosophers made the most confusing issues \"(\" On the State \"). The so-called \"clean government\" the \"miscarriage of justice\" and the like, as part of the national problem, I am afraid the landlord class and the bourgeoisie made particularly confusing, poison the minds of the people and became a superstition. Marxism-Leninism has the responsibility to to expose such illusion, get rid of this superstition. \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" On the contrary, it is not only not to get rid of this superstition, and beautify the landlord class in every possible way in the name of the new historical operas officials, courts, law and deepen this superstition. The farmers would also have to know the \"up and down are the official World\", \"rational without money do not go inside, Hai an appearance indignation asked farmers, landowners bullies\" with which no justice? \"Lessons of farmers:\" It is you, why not sue? \"In the process of the\" miscarriage of justice \", but also repeatedly emphasized the\" Prince breaking the law, to cover up the essence of the \"no justice\" class and the common people with the crime of \"like so and proved practical action: As long as Hai \"clean government\" act \"no justice, will be able to make the court into place to protect farmers, will be able to\" the people to avenge \"can be rehabilitated.\" miscarriage of justice \" farmers&#39; access to land. This is not all the state machinery of the landlord class as a tool to protect farmers it? This is not the nature of the landlord class dictatorship to suppress the peasants obliterated? This is not a publicity as long as there is a great master of the landlord class, honest and upright official in the judgment hall \"the people decide\" farmers \"divisions\" will be able to get liberated? Beautify the landlord class country this big publicity Do not revolutionary drama of class conciliation, and also talk about what \"historical drama creation must be guided by Marxism-Leninism, [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] Mao Zedong Thought as the guide\" ¢Ù ¢Ü ? <br> classes and the state since the human society since the world does not appear too great lord people make decisions \"thing. In China, not only the landlord class reformists, the bourgeois democrats never what the \"good life\" to the farmers. Only the leadership of the Communist Party of China&#39;s great revolution completely shattered the state machinery of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, the proletariat for leadership (history TodayOnHistory.com) based on the alliance of workers and peasants, the People&#39;s Republic of China, the only solution Jiangnan and the \"land\" of the National Farmers&#39; clothing rice. This is, after all, is the fact that no one can overthrow the iron. <br> our hope of Comrade Wu Han Hai image to portray himself preached viewpoints in this image, with Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly stated that the point of view of the Marxist-Leninist control Taken together, it is not difficult to find, Comrade Wu Han precisely landlords and bourgeois concept instead of a national view of Marxism-Leninism, used the class conciliation instead of the class struggle theory. Promote these landlords and the bourgeoisie today boast antiquated view of thousands of years, and why? What is beneficial to whom? The need to distinguish between right and wrong. <br> \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\" want people to learn something? <br> Hai is an influential historical figures. It seems that he is a feudal society in a period of decline of the landlord class in a more far-sighted character. His loyalty to the feudal system, feudal dynasty \"loyalists\". He saw the peasantry was sharp conflicts with the landlord class some phenomenon, see the class some internal corruption phenomenon was not conducive to the dynasty rule, in order to consolidate the feudal rule weakened peasant resistance to ease the sharp class contradictions in order to maintain the feudal dynasty the fundamental interests of his courage to some group or some of the measures that endanger the interests of the feudal dynasty sharp struggle. On a number of things, he is consistent with the small landlords and rich peasants interests suppression despotic landlord, or for the purpose of consolidating the entire landlord class the dictatorship of farmers, safeguarding the interests of the imperial dynasty. Him on the \"law and order sparse, Comrade Wu Han and many articles, drama, said to be representing the interests of the people, things, and also was specifically compiled acted in new historical drama\" Hai Shang Shu \"¢Ù ¢Ý However, as in sparse at the very start said: He believes that the \"Jun, world subjects, the Lord of all things also. \"His aim is to seek eternal security\" Dynasty \". This action can only description of him as He Zhongjun, but can not explain anything else. Jiajing emperor did not kill him, after his death, the Emperor is very sad, \"to gift Taizaishaobao, posthumous loyalty referral. Ministry of Rites left assistant minister also said: \"strengths can not harmonic, while the end of the straight heart to fortuity\" funeral. Feudal dynasty is very shrewd Hai is a loyal defender of the interests of the landlord class. This is the the the Hai class nature, is Hai the starting point and destination of all the action. Like Comrade Wu Han Hai portrayed as the interests of farmers, representatives said what Hairui \"protect the people, all for the sake of the people\", he is for the interests of the people struggle ¢Ù ¢Þ even he said is not afraid of the feudal bureaucratic forces hero, this is a complete distortion of the Hai class outlook. Ming Dynasty praise Hai \"protect people such as child\", Comrade Wu Han said he was \"all for the sake of the people\" (the L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) Will the two in the end what is the difference then? <br> has always been the history books of the landlord class, also had big book particularize many materials Ming Hairui how \"everything is everywhere people\" Hai served as the Jiangnan governor period, how big anti Xu Jie, large engage in paddy fields, how to \"less than a month to fix the Wusong River, the people praise his\" Dragon King \", and so on. Therefore, after his death, \"little people strike, on funeral Chujiang, the white dressed sender Gaan, to sprinkle cry by hundreds of miles without a break. \"These records, old novel, the rendering of the old plays, it is easy to confuse the people. However, the official book of records, apparently contains the exaggerated ingredients of the landlord class class point of view, we should carefully analyze. ?'
