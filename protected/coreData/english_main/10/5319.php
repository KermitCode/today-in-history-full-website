'cont'=>'(Bingshen April 27), June 10, 1836, the French physicist Ampere&#39;s death. <br> Andre Marie Ampere (1775 -1836 on June 10, 2011), a French chemist, remarkable research achievements of the electromagnetic interaction of mathematics and The physical also contribute. People familiar with the current strength of the unit - amps, (l $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) to commemorate the January 1775 Sunrise was born in Lyon, France, physicist Andre-Marie Ampere (Andre M. Ampere) named. <br> amps wealthy, his father is deeply influenced by the theories of Rousseau education, in particular the establishment of a well-stocked private libraries, so his child, he read many books. These books not only made him appreciate the noble side of life inspired his interest in the natural sciences, mathematics and philosophy. The amperes of (lsjt.org) <br> is a mathematical genius, the older little basic knowledge of mathematics and geometry have learned; 12-year-old started to learn calculus; the age of 18 has been able to repeat the Lagrange Analytical Mechanics \" Some calculation. In Lyon in 1799 as a mathematics teacher, and began a systematic study of mathematics, probability theory, and later wrote a thesis. <br> amps extraordinary wisdom, good use of mathematical quantitative analysis, thus continuously improve his academic status. He was hired as a professor of physics and mathematical analysis of the Faculties, more invited to the Royal Society. <br> amperes development of electromagnetism can be withheld. He not only created the term \"current\" turn positive flow direction as the direction of the current. 1820 Oersted&#39;s discovery of the \"magnetic effect\" of the current was a lot about the current and magnet interaction experiments, draw several important results: (a) the two distances similar intensity equal and opposite the force generated by a current of the other current can cancel each other out; (b) in the bent wires of the current may be regarded as composed of many small pieces of the current, and its role is equal to these small current vector and; (c) when while increasing multiples of the same length and the role of the current-carrying conductor of distance, the force will remain unchanged. After some quantitative analysis, he finally discovered in 1822 Ampere&#39;s law, and in 1826 launched the force between two current formula. Ampere outstanding achievements in electromagnetism is obvious to many physicists are extremely impressive. <br> 1836 amps in Marseille, France, died at 61 years. <br>'
