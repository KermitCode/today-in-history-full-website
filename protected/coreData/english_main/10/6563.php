'cont'=>'July 10, 1856 (hare on June ninth day), AC father of the birth of Nikola Tesla. <br> Nikola Tesla (Nikola Tesla, 1856 -1943 on January 7), is a world-renowned inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and motor engineer. Serbian descent, he was born in Croatia (later incorporated into the Austrian Empire). Tesla is considered to be an important inventor in history. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, he made an outstanding contribution to the electric and magnetic. His patents and theoretical work form the basis of modern alternating current electric power (AC) systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, to help him bring up the second industrial revolution. the <br> \"the scientific community is generally agreed that the two human history Masterpieces Wizards &#8226; tat &#8226; Vinci, Leonardo (Leonardo Di Ser Piero Da Vinci), the other is Nicholas &#8226; Tesla (Nikola Tesla). \"In July 1856, he was born in Yugoslavia and Croatia M. Liang, his father was a pastor, my mother is the inventor of the eggbeater. His life countless invention. Following Edison invented the direct current (DC) in 1882, he soon invented the alternating current (AC), and manufactured the world&#39;s first alternator, and the creation of a multi-phase power transmission technology. In 1895, he manufacture of generator sets for the Niagara power station, causing the power station is still one of the world-famous hydropower. 1897, (l $ j而.c里) he Marconi&#39;s radio communication theory become a reality. In 1898, he produced a radio-controlled boat in the world&#39;s first radio-controlled technology patented (U.S. patent # 613.809). In 1899, he invented the photographic technique of X-ray (X-Ray). Other inventions include: radio, radar, fax machines, vacuum tubes, neon tubes, missile navigation planet defense system. Even named after his name and the magnetic density units (1 Tesla = 10,000 Gause) that his contribution to the magnetic. <br> young man&#39;s Tesla is very smart, quickly complete complex calculations in your head, the teacher always thought he was cheating. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> Tesla can speak multiple languages &#8203;&#8203;fluently. In addition to the Croatian, he also said seven languages: Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Latin. $ Dj而.c身m] <br> midlife Tesla &#8226; Mark Twain became close friends, a lot of time they spend in the laboratory and elsewhere. <br> in the United States, Tesla&#39;s reputation in history or popular culture can be comparable to any other inventor or scientist. In 1893, he showed the wireless communications and became the winner of the Battle of current, become one of the greatest electronic engineers and highly respected. Many of his early achievements become a pioneer of modern electronic engineering, and many of his discovery of groundbreaking importance. In the year 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court to recognize him as the inventor of the radio. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) <br> Tesla&#39;s legacy can be seen everywhere in the modern world, the use of electricity. Apart from his achievements in electromagnetism and engineering, Tesla is considered the finest variety of areas of robotics, ballistics, computer science, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics contribute. Tesla in his later years was regarded as a mad scientist and claimed to be able to create a weird science invention Note. Many of his achievements have been accompanied by some controversy applications to support a lot of pseudo-science, such as UFO theories and new century mystical theory. Tesla contemporary admirers saw him as a \"creation of the twentieth century\". (Lssjt.cn) <br> great man he is a forgotten world. Alternator is his invention, but Edison to love their invention DC generator, strongly suppressed Tesla. If Tesla is not forced to give up the franchise of the AC for the world to use free of charge ($ 2.53 per horsepower), that he would be the richest people in the world. His dream is to provide the world with inexhaustible energy. Tesla did not care for his financial condition, in the case of poor and forgotten, died at the age of 86 years. Although he is a peerless genius, but unfortunately not many people remember him. <br> world-renowned genius inventor, and his many significant inventions, for the progress of human society played an important role. <br>'
