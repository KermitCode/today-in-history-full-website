Half hours after the air strikes, Israeli ground forces also launched an attack on the Arab countries but resistance. 10 days the end of the war, the failure of the Arab countries. This is the third war in the Middle East, also known as the \"Six Five war\" or the \"Six Day War\". <br> 1967: The Blitz protagonist Air Force June 5, 1967, Israel sent out all the air force launched a massive surprise attack on Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria and Jordan. On this day, the Israeli air force is almost out in force, and even the trainer into the battle, attacked Air Force Base 25 Arab countries. 60 hours after the war, Israel destroyed 451 Arab countries aircraft, including Egypt, on the loss of the aircraft 336 lost 60 in Syria, Jordan lost 29, lost 25 in Iraq, Lebanon lost one. Egyptian combat aircraft loss of 95% of the entire Egyptian Air Force paralyzed, while Israel lost 26 aircraft. <br> Soviet planning war. The United States had planned to attack Israeli Soviet disinformation and other means to deliberately provoked this war between the Arab-Israeli. The Soviet Union did so, Israel made a huge breakthrough in nuclear research. In order to deal with this threat, the Soviet Union hope that the joint war bombing of Israel&#39;s Dimona nuclear facility in Egypt, they even plan in the Israeli coastal landing. At that time, the Soviet nuclear submarine approaching the coast of Israel, so that Israel was prepared to use nuclear weapons when their counterattack. Similarly, the eve of the war, the United States had to develop a secret military program, if Israel eastward into the West Bank or the west will Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula, (L $ dj而.c身m) American military strikes. However, this plan ultimately ended in abortion. And let the U.S. and the USSR playing with toys, the faster the speed of the Israeli army. Third Middle East War <br> called the War history classic battle. In this war, Israel occupied the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and the Old City of Jerusalem, Egypt&#39;s Sinai Peninsula and Syria&#39;s Golan Heights, a total of 65,000 square km of Arab land, in order to determine Israel strategic advantage. However, the war did not bring Israel expect peace, it triggered a series of problems still affect today&#39;s situation in the Arab-Israeli, Israelis and Palestinians at the same time suffering from the pain of the conflict. Raymond Cohen, professor of international relations of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said in talking about the war, the war is the continuation of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948. Objectively speaking, the third war in the Middle East is in the pan-Arab political movement in the 1950s and gradually achieve development context. At that time, Egypt, Jordan and Syria signed a mutual defense agreement, and passed before the war to destroy the State of Israel, \"the voice. Israel regardless of the number of troops or equipment can not be with the Egyptian, about (the L $ dj而.c身m) Syria Three rival. In this case, the \"fight for survival\" Israel has made in just six days war victory, and thus change its position in the Middle East countries, \"a Jewish state in the Middle East the presence of the region have to accept the reality of the other countries of the same region. Professor Cohen&#39;s point of view, in line with the thoughts of many Israelis. <br> However, the developments that, Cohen said that \"reality\" has been a constant challenge in the event. Period, in addition angstroms to about to end through peaceful negotiations to achieve the normalization of bilateral relations, the Palestinian refugee problem, the problem of the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights issue interest because the parties involved legacy to the political, religious, ethnic, and many other complex factors the, [而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m] Later, the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, Syria contradiction protracted obstacles. <br> which is the problem of Israel&#39;s post-war policy. For example: the construction of Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, and other places, and the intensification of the contradictions of the Palestinians in Israel with local; construction of multiple checkpoints hinder the Palestinian areas and commodity circulation, causing the Pakistan economic deterioration and humanitarian crisis, lead to a more violent resistance to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian people, and so on. Had approved the establishment of certain settlements to Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres also acknowledged that the establishment of settlements in highly populated Palestinian Hebron \"was a mistake\". In addition, the rise of regional extremist forces to problem solve more complicated. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has refused to accept the three principles of the Middle East Quartet to renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement, Israel can not in any way accept. <br> Peres: third victory of the war in the Middle East for Israel is memorable, unfortunately, it is not the last war. \"Indeed, in the ensuing 40 years, the large and small conflicts between Israel and the Palestinians, Lebanon occur frequently, until today still continues. The war on the one hand claimed thousands of lives, on the one hand, also warned that it does not solve the problem. <br> reflect on the war, Israelis should derive inspiration: the war will not bring true peace. <br>'
