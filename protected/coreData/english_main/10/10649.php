Tolstoy reason for immortal reputation, mainly due to two of his novels \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna - Karenina\". The Tolstoy heart full of profound contradictions. He is an individualistic nobility, in his old age, very unsuccessfully trying over the life of a poor peasants; At first he had to indulge in sensual eventually become a radical Puritan; him extraordinary vitality, but almost always afraid of death. This strange dual personality make him abandon his simple life of middle-aged novelist&#39;s career and became a devout Christian; him write out a steady stream of papers, pamphlets, and most of the preaching of short stories and screenplays He preached love and loyalty to the faith and life of the property and the government and the church like artificial system disdain. early years, and the marriage of <br> Lev - Nikolayevich Abramovich - Count Tolstoy, September 9, 1828 (the Lunar August 28) was born about 160 kilometers south of Moscow, his family manor Asia斯纳亚波利 Mariana (case of Tula Province). Tolstoy since childhood, his parents died by the relatives and dependents. The early years taught by a tutor, at age 16 into the Kazan University, but disappointed with the teaching of the school stereotype, operating his manor and arrange their own academic return 亚斯纳亚波 Liana 1847. His two no into, Suiyou the to abandon pastoral life, and to join the Moscow and St. Petersburg mediocre troubles the circle. In his diary, he describes the behavior of their own moral transgressions. Good ulterior motives for their behavior realism explore youthful diary has been revealed, the analysis in order to exhibit unusual. <br> tired of this mediocre life, Tolstoy defected in 1851 he was a soldier in the Caucasus brother Nicholas. The second year, he also participated in the armed forces and bravery in combat several times with the hill tribes, most of his spare time for writing, and wrote his first published work, \"childhood\", published in \"Modern people \"magazine. In the <br> 1854, Tolstoy was transferred to the Danube front, to participate in the Battle of the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, he described these experiences in the Sevastopol Stories \" , in which he contrasts the brave the simple ordinary soldiers fought bravely and upper officers affectation. After the end of the war in 1856, he left the army to St. Petersburg, where he became a competing literary group objects of worship, they compete for his support of their social and aesthetic point of view. As a clear attitude individualist, he categorically abandoned these literati coterie back to 亚斯纳亚波 Liana. <br> 1857 traveled to France, Switzerland and Germany. The Tolstoy <br> 1862 and came from the educated middle price level home bers married. He interrupted his education activities, and in the subsequent 15 years, with all his heart unto the married life. Most of the time my married life warm and happy, they total birth to 13 children. Estate management well, and resume writing, and wrote his two greatest masterpiece \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna - Karenina\". the <br> two masterpiece Tolstoy created nearly seven years to his epic macro chapter masterpiece, \"War and Peace\", this work is generally considered to be the world literature, the two or three greatest novels a. Regardless of the scope or writing strokes, this masterpiece is far better than his previous works. In this novel, all living material woven into a magnificent, colorful screen, rich materials and a large number of characters are incomparable objective processing and portrayed, probably so no one other novel by an accurate grasp of the practical details micro fine people and amazing, all kinds of psychological analysis to reflect the overall style of the full natural life. <br> Anna - Karenina \"with\" War and Peace \"at least in the method and style of narrative approximate it in art is more unified. In the time between writing two books, Tolstoy&#39;s philosophy of life changes gradually. \"War and Peace\" is a love of life optimism novel, its main characters are morally sound, they are able to master their own inner conflicts; description of Russian society in the 1860s, \"Anna - Karenina \"pessimism, it&#39;s the character&#39;s inner conflict often remain unresolved, and sometimes lead to human scourge. <br> elderly Tolstoy strongly feel pampered life and he had to be in his family life (a kind of get rid of the secular materialism, the simple life of the monastic hermit devotion to the service of others) between the contradictions and pain. He realized that his situation is a mockery of the beliefs he announced, finally, deteriorating family situation forced Tolstoy secret runaways in one night; accompanied by his peers with his doctors and small daughter Alexandria Della, he hoped to find a quiet life and God closer hideouts. A few days later, the old calendar, November 20 (November 7), pneumonia, he died in sorghum praise Province remote 阿斯塔波沃 train station. <br> evaluation Tolstoy outstanding achievements as a writer, critic never rarely questioned; He is recognized as the world&#39;s greatest novelist. Although Tolstoy never inherited Russian writers before him, but may be influenced by some foreign writers such as Rousseau, Stern, Stendhal and later Thackeray, but his reputation as a thinker, people are never the same views, however, the duality of Tolstoy&#39;s moral and intellectual development has been a more thorough understanding of modern scholars who study his thought. When when he tirelessly searching for truth, he tried a knowledge of incomplete, imperfect human world seeking the absolute truth. As a result, he&#39;s unwilling to compromise, completely rational explanation for the force, he tends to make his theory to the point of absurdity; Many people believe that his views on history, non-violence, education and the arts, has been very close to such a ridiculous situation. But as long as the systematic study of his thought, you will find the relationship between it and all the ideas of the 19th century liberalism. He believes that the whole history of two thousand years, is mainly constituted by the individual&#39;s moral progress and moral corruption of government. Tolstoy put his faith lies in the moral progress of the people that it is for most people generally decisive answer to oppression by a few people. He believes that, contrary to the doctrine of class struggle and Marxist economic determinism and the use of violence, prompting human reach no class and no national state of the progressive movement depends on each individual pursues supreme love of the law, and thus abandon any form of violence : through it all to make their own moral being perfected. Tolstoy lead his rationalism to the extreme, he is in today is still recognized as one of the most influential 19th-century moralist.
