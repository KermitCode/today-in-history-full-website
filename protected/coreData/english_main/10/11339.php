'cont'=>'In (Ding October 19), December 10, 1957, the world&#39;s first underground gas power plant commissioning success. <br> 1957 12 10, 2009, the world&#39;s first coal underground gasification gas-fueled power station turbine in Tula commissioning. <br> Moscow from the rich lignite coalfield where new made gas turbines burning gas. The test marks the successful completion of the coal mining industry in a huge technological revolution, it will allow the miners freed from the hardships of the underground labor, and you can save a lot of money. It has been calculated that if the establishment of such large enterprises, the annual produce billions of cubic meters of gas, the cost of power production using this method than with ordinary open mining production cost of power to halve or two-thirds. Labor productivity will also increase to three or four times. Staff can be less than the ordinary electric factory three-quarters. <br> a long time, people have been dreaming of the direct use of coal can without having it dug up from deep underground. The great Russian scientist doors Dire Yevgeny had put forth this theory. In the Soviet Union, several underground gas center, experimental work in this regard since 1931, to identify the make coal burn method to identify the control invisible, the complexity of the coal combustion process and derive the gas . <br> but the construction of the underground gas after gas-powered power stations must also be highly heat-resistant steel production and the manufacture of turbine blades, must ensure that the machine equipment from hot and cold, but also must be designed such turbines and so on. Now, all of these issues have been resolved. [History today www.lssdjt.com] base of this new type of power station fuel <br> built near Tula, four, and 50 meters deep in the ground, where burning coal seam, puffing amazing flaming flame temperature up to more than 1000 degrees Celsius. People using a variety of specialized instruments on the ground to manipulate the process of fuel combustion. Hour, more than 40,000 cubic meters of gas along the pipe diameter of 180 cm to the combustion chamber. The geologists determined, power stations rely on coal seam reserves reached 5,000 tons, can be used as long as 70 years. <br> addition to towngas, compressor hour to 200,000 cubic meters of air admitted to the combustion chamber. Gas combustion gas temperatures up to 650 degrees to promote the turbine blades, and so according to the principles of the jet engine. The power turbines hair is 12,000 kilowatts. Currently, the Soviet Union was still building this power station to be tested. <br> Soviet Minister of geology and mineral resources protection °²ÌØÂÞ²¨·ò said, in Eastern Siberia, Yakutia Autonomous Republic Lena coal zone is the world&#39;s largest coal district. Entirely based on total coal reserves of the world, where coal reserves than they are now already know more than doubled to a half times. Coal zone has proven coal reserves of nearly 5 trillion tons. <br>'
