'title'=>'The death of the famous British scientist Cavendish',
'class'=>3,
'cont'=>'On February sixth days) (Gengwu years, March 10, 1810, the famous British scientist Cavendish died. <br> Cavendish (Henry Cavendish, 1731 ~ 1810), British physicist and chemist. Born October 10, 1731 in Nice, France. One of the significant contribution of the Cavendish in 1798 to complete the measurement of gravitation torsion balance experiment, later known as the Cavendish experiment. He improved a British mechanic Michelle (John Michell, 1724 to 1793) designed torsion balance, additional Xiaoping mirror hanging wire system on the use of the telescope in the outdoor remote control and measurement, to prevent the disturbance of the air (time No vacuum equipment). Silver-coated copper wire with a 39 inch hanging a 6-foot-wood, the rod ends of each fixed a diameter of 2 inches Shot attract them, and the other with two 12-inch diameter fixed Shot, measured Shot between gravitational wobble cycle, thereby calculate the two Shot gravitational, obtained by the calculation of the mass and density of the Earth&#39;s gravitation pushed calculated. Earth he calculated density of 5.481 times the density of water (the modern values &#8203;&#8203;of the Earth&#39;s density 5.517g/cm3), thereby calculate the value of the gravitation constant G 6.754 ¡Á 10-11 Nm2/kg2 (modern value of the top four number of 6.672). The conception, design and operation of this experiment is very delicate, the British physicist JH Poynting once this experiment under the reviews: \"to create a new era of the weak force measurement. <br> Cavendish in 1766 published \"On artificial air\" papers and was the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. He made out of pure oxygen, and the oxygen in the air, the nitrogen content, that water is not an element but a compound. He was known as \"Chemical Newton. Cavendish life in their own laboratory work, is known as the \"richest scholars, the most learned of the rich. Cavendish died on February 24, 1810. <br>'
