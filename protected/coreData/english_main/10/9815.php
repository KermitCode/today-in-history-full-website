'cont'=>'October 10, 1980, the first two days of September (Gengshen years), People&#39;s Artist Zhao Dan&#39;s death. the <br> left: Zhou Enlai, Wang, Xu Tao (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) Zhao Dan <br> 1980 October 10, 2010, the People&#39;s Artist Zhao Dan suffering cancer, died at the age of 65. (Lssdjt.com) <br> Zhao Dan, formerly known as The Exploration and Analysis for the New Teaching Mode, native of Feicheng, ranking Nantong, Jiangsu, was born in 1915. 1957 joined the Chinese Communist Party. In middle school, his love of the dramatic arts. 1931 to admitted to Shanghaimeizhuan learning Chinese painting. In 1933, in the case of the White Terror extremely serious, he took part in the Chinese left-wing dramatist Union engaged in the advancement drama movement and into the film industry. From the \"pipa spring complain\" a few years, he has participated in the shooting of more than 20 films. Especially in the \"Crossroads\" show \"Street Angel\" was a success, and became a star most viewers. In 1937, Zhao Dan, and many of the movie theater workers together, active anti-Japanese propaganda. In 1938, Zhao Dan went to Xinjiang pioneering theatrical work was reactionary warlord Sheng cruel persecution, prison for 5 years. After the war, Zhao Dan returned to Shanghai to participate in the direct leadership of Comrade Zhou Enlai Kunlun Film Company, starring \"distant love\", \"The Raven and the Sparrow movie. <br> founding of New China, Zhao Dan artistic talent has the freedom to display their vast. He succeeded in shaping the artistic image of Li, Lin, Nie Er Hui Wan, left valuable wealth for the Performing Arts of the Chinese film, winning a domestic and international audience and critics praised. Catastrophe in 10 years, the \"Gang of Four\" appalling persecution he held for five years. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> two days before his death, (Lssdjt.com) October 8, 1980, \"People&#39;s Daily\" published articles written by Zhao Dan tube too specific literary did not the \": <br>\" People&#39;s Daily \"is being carried out to\" improve the leadership of the Party on art, literature and art to enliven the discussion. See \"improvement\" to \"invigorate\" the title quite hi; see \"Editor&#39;s Note\" in the party leadership of the literary work must be improved to achieve enhanced by improving, in this regard, we are unwavering, but also worried. I do not know how wide the scope of the \"Editor&#39;s Note\" in \"We\". I just know that some of our artists - loyalty to the party&#39;s cause, indomitable heard to strengthen the party&#39;s leadership, will be conditioned to timid. Has previous experience of political movement, every strengthening one more big toss, cross interference, until the \"total dictatorship. Remember, even worse, a special feeling. The future can do as \"strengthening\". <br> I think: to strengthen or improve the party&#39;s leadership on the literary means to master and implement the party&#39;s arts policy, specifically, is the party how to unswervingly implement the principle of \"double hundred\". <br> As for specific literary and artistic creation, the party whether or not to leadership? Party in the end how the leadership? formulated <br> the party leadership of the national economic plan, the party leadership of the agricultural policy, the implementation of the industrial policy; the leadership of the party need not, however, how to farm, how to do the bench, how to cut pants, how cooking need not leading writers how writing, the actors how to act. Literary, Literature and Art, if the party tube literary tube too specific, art is no hope, they finished. \"Gang of Four\" tube art is the most specific, a belt with the actor who, a patch tube, the tube 800 million people only eight play it not from the sides of excitation alert us? ! <br> which writer is a party called him as a writer when the writer? Lu Xun, Mao Dun it really listened to the words of the party before writing? The party called to write what was to write what? ! Well, Marx who told him to write? Life struggle - the course of history, have a certain culture, creating an era of artists, theorists, the leading position for centuries. From the strength of character of literature and art - philosophy, it is not which party, which faction level organizations, which branch Guan Dele. Insisted pipe so specific, that is asking for trouble, thankless task, is the scourge of the literary. <br> each layer competent literary leaders say their \"adhere to the Party&#39;s literary policy, adhere to the ideas of revolutionary literature and art, as if the only the the the literary specialist who touches vertigo deaf Simpleton&#39;s face in the crowd. Otherwise, the founding of 30 years, \"the May Fourth New Culture Movement 60 years, the national army of proletarian literature and art has known millions, why from the central as well as provincial, district, county, commune, factories, mines, and they are even always do not know or do not know much literary amateurs collar while the guide of assured it? Really puzzling logic! In particular, the more senior leadership layman, power is highly centralized, so in the process of conversion of an outsider to the insiders, millions of literary army had to follow treads upon the earth turn, not to mention some leaders refused to turn, because a professionals, they might not be when the leadership it? Not to mention living rapid speed, the experts also chase the less performance and effort, plus interfering heavily, resulting in the more popular works of literary positions, most only reach the great truth of the talk of the town level. (Lssjt.cn) <br> Institute of Arts, literature and art groups want mandatory only guidelines for what is thought? Not to a previous publication for the purpose? I want to seriously think about a proposed meeting. I do not as well. Through the ages in the history of art, the statue a while deposed 100 when, will not have the prosperity of literature and art. <br>-fifth the Third Session of the NPC and CPPCC delegates enthusiastically discuss institutional issues. \"Institutional\" word, our artists originally unfamiliar. Later gradually: we are too lazy tube \"system\", \"system\" can doom manage; forcing us to have to seriously deal with to deal with it. <br> ask, which several countries in the world, accounting for such a large proportion of non-professional cadres in the fields of literature and arts, so as my? Let this society, and out of fashion who feed who except farmers and youth (as well as some of the elderly and women), and finally one each of the \"iron rice bowl\". But why should the tightly grabbed so many non-artistic cadres to manage artists? Some non-art cadres in other jobs might make a difference. However, so many swimmer pushed a \"pool\", only candles. Each a \"leading cadres of the art\", in order to devote themselves to their duties, always speak artistic creation, have insights, difficult to unification. Like the shooting of this movie \"Lu Xun\", since the 1960 trial lens, mustache stay and shaved and shaved and stay, which lasted 20 years, such a big country like we, five different styles, drawing times and from different angles, \"Lu Xun\" the film is out, now, not even the thunder faint. This is not the artistic life of an actor can not stand the problem, \"Lu Xun\" movie of the delay can not come out, the real is also linked to a new generation of Lu Xun Literature and Art was born. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> literary and artistic creation is the most personality, literary and artistic creation can not engage in a show of hands by! Can comment, criticism, can encourage, and can be applauded. From a historical era, the art is unrestricted, and also do not limit. <br> habits, not the truth. Bad habits, not to the system of compliance with iron nails. Cengcengbaguan review of the trial no good works, good works always has been a viable review out! Movie every debate, I want to speak are guilty of addiction. Sometimes want to resist the temptation to say. I have nothing to fear. I just feel a bit long-winded enough, how much effect? ...... <br> [80 September] bed posthumous <br> Zhao Dan \"gates of hell\" <br> Zhao Dan posthumous screen the image creating \"<br> critically ill of Zhao Dan <br> Zhao Dan (third from right) together with an old friend of the upper shadow <br> and Mrs. Huang Zongying ( in), $ dj而.c身m daughter of Zhao Qing (left) tour the Great Wall <br>'
