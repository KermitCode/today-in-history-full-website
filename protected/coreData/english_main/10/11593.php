'cont'=>'December 10, 2008 (Lunar New Year winter months 13), American NASA Hubble Telescope discovered extrasolar planetary atmospheres containing carbon dioxide. <br> 2008 December 10, 2011, the U.S. NASA Hubble Telescope discovered extrasolar planetary atmospheres containing carbon dioxide. <br> NASA through the Hubble telescope, observed extrasolar a hot planet&#39;s atmosphere with carbon dioxide. This the first time astronomers have discovered extrasolar planetary atmospheres carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is one of the four chemical elements of life on Earth, to detect the presence of carbon dioxide in the far outer space, astronomers will be able explore the signs of the existence of life on other planets. called \"HD 189733b\", <br> extrasolar planets volume equivalent to Jupiter, about 63 light years from Earth, the surface temperatures up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, for life to exist. <br> However, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed \"HD 189733b\" carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane atmosphere, astronomers are very encouraging, because carbon dioxide is an important material constituting the organic life, may make looking for distant Earth-like planets research breakthrough. Washington, Carnegie Institute of Planetary <br> composition theorists Bowes said: \"This is the first human to detect the presence of carbon dioxide in the extrasolar planetary atmospheres, this also means that suitable for the existence of life or existing life four iconic elements of the world of the existence of the universe, have now found three: water, methane, and the discovery of carbon dioxide. Now only a most critical elements have not yet found in outer space, that is, oxygen or ozone. \"<br> Review: Exploring the Universe secret desire of every people on earth <br>'
