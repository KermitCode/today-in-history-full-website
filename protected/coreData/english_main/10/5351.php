'cont'=>'June 10, 1999 (April 27) JiMao Chinese American Young to the success of the first case of non-reproductive cell cloned cattle. June <br> 1999, Biotechnology Research Center of the University of Connecticut, USA consultant and the animal technical director, project research led by a non-reproductive cell cloned cattle Chinese Yang in the first in the world-wide non-reproductive cells cloned cattle successfully. On June 24, the Chinese Consul General in New York, Qiu Shengyun a cordial meeting with the Consulate General and the Yang to dinner, and he transmitted a message from the International Department of the Chinese Ministry of Education. He wished Yang to achieve greater achievements. <br> Yang Qiu Shengyun Consul General thanked congratulations. He said the project is the result of hard work of the 15 experts of his laboratory, also benefited from the active support of the leadership of his University of Connecticut. He said that the efforts to promote the Cornell and other U.S. universities and academic institutions in academic exchanges with China. <br> Yang is a Chinese-American Society of Agronomy, promoters and first chairman of the current Chinese-American experts and professors of the President of the Federation. Reference January 2000, Young announced to the press to the middle-man, using in vitro long-term culture of Bulls ear skin cells successfully cloned calves 6. To break this important achievements of the scientific community that only the use of the traditional concept of fresh or short-term culture of cells before cloning it possible to make large quantities of cloned cattle, and in the use of cloning technology for gene function positioning, diagnosis and prevention of genetic diseases, the organization and organ repair as well as aging and longevity research has opened up new avenues. Animal transgenic founder Tom Wagner, director of the Cancer Research Center, South Carolina, United States, said that the results of both from the point of view of science or commercialization see, must ±È¿ËÂ¡¶àÀò the sheep is much more important. In early January, the International embryos Society Annual Meeting held in the Netherlands, more than 1,000 participants from 42 countries, scholars agree that this is one of the scientific and technological achievements of the century&#39;s most important. of <br> Young to the same had to work in his laboratory the Japanese scientists Kubota force to remove cells from a 17-year-old Japanese bull ears, two months in vitro in December 1998 after four young bull cloned 2 year old. In early February 1999, they went with the culture three months, split 30 on behalf of the Bulls cells cloned two young bulls, two healthy young bulls full 10 months. <br> Professor Yang Xiangzhong more than 40 years old, born in Handan, Hebei rural childhood like the production team volunteered for the pig farming animals, graduated from high school in their hometowns, start deal and animal. 1977, after the restoration of the college entrance examination was admitted to the Beijing Agricultural University, Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary obtain the Ministry of Education conferred to foreign students went to Cornell University in 1983, stayed on to teach PhD, presided Biotechnology Center to the University of Connecticut in 1996. (? V history today?? Com) reporter asked him to talk about the reasons for the success, he very clearly said that science and technology focusing on innovation, our success lies in the idea of &#8203;&#8203;innovation. Cloning technology, the original people that must stem cells to develop into somatic innovation; the original must we switch to the other parts of the cells of the genital organs, cells and innovation. Original cell clones with more fresh as possible, but is not conducive to the practical application of fresh cells, we changed to the long-term culture of cells cloned, it is an innovative propulsion technology development. Innovation is not come out of thin air, it requires the accumulation of knowledge, I have since 1983 been engaged in animal cloning research around the world hundreds Laboratory decades accumulation of knowledge in cloning technology is also very important. Understanding of the results of their predecessors, the current situation, the problems, will it be possible to develop new ideas and challenge to the traditional concept. The first is to determine the direction, and then the hard work, perseverance. Innovation is endless, this breakthrough we also put forward more new issues, (History Today www.lssdjt.com) Why somatic cells than dry cell efficiency cells cloned but better long-term culture, there cell gene cloning process open questions, they also need the scientists are trying to discover, to seek new breakthroughs in science and technology is the continuous development of innovation. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> Yang to come to the United States for many years, fruitful overseas, but the heart has been thinking toward China, the hometown farmer. Every year to return a few ideas for the country&#39;s science and technology and agricultural development, to make their own strength. Cornell University study, he initiated the establishment of the \"America Society of Agronomy, promote Sino-US agricultural scientific and technological exchanges. He also initiated the establishment of the \"Chinese Bridge Foundation in locally raised funds to help the United States of Chinese scholars to return home to carry out academic exchanges, the past few years, there are more than 200 Chinese scholars in the\" Chinese Bridge \"funding to domestic service. He said that the Chinese people are smart, capable, and can endure hardship, can make greater contributions to the field of science and technology. Domestic animal technology, a lot of talent, high level. It should be noted that the external to strengthen international exchanges, the integrate domestic research project into the international community, to learn the latest international technology and information. Internally to strengthen the cooperation the research existing competition, but also cooperation and cooperation in order to play to the advantage of all parties, to achieve better results. <br>'
