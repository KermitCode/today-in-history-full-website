'cont'=>'April 10, 1994 (February 30) Awake, the scientists found the Himalayas similar castles in the air. In April <br> 1994, scientists found that the highest mountains in the Himalayas on Earth actually like castles in the air, there is no general mountains should great Yamane, which became the mysteries of the Tibetan Plateau Mountains. <br> According to participate in the Eighth Five-Year Plan \"Climbing Program Tibetan Plateau formation, evolution and environmental changes and ecosystem research project scientists fieldwork found that the highest land on Earth, with an average altitude of 4,500 meters several huge mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and almost has the the same lack Yamane characteristics. , \"Yamane huge mountains due to gravity and penetrate the crust deep into the Earth&#39;s lava, mantle structure is part <br> Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology, Research Associate Li Shijie. According to the general principles of mechanics, the greater the mountains, the heavier the volume, it Yamane bigger deep, so as to maintain the balance of forces. <br> on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, several huge mountains are world-class mountain. 14 peak 8,000 meters above sea level, nine in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In particular, is known as the highest in the world, Mount Everest, altitude 8848 meters, the weight of the mountain can be imagined, plus the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a young continent, thin crust, general common sense, these huge mountains full weight penetrate the mantle buried in huge YAMANE. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> puzzling, these behemoths are completely non-compliance \"common sense\" and the towering. <br> According to scientists speculated that the big mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Yamane, land reclamation movement that may be formed in the same plateau. In the Pan-African events dating back 5-4 million years ago occurred in the history of the geological structure, the Tibetan Plateau from Lhasa&#39;s land mass and its adjacent areas of mutual Flatten, become Gugangwana mainland part. After a billion years more stable development in the Devonian period 400 million years, the super continent began to rotate clockwise motion, Permian and continued into the mid-change trigger a global pattern of land and sea. Thereafter to the Pliocene and Quaternary turn of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau began significantly strong uplift, and has not stopped. Not yet formed Yamane. <br> In addition, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the form of plate motions may affect [$ dj而.c身m this plateau is the Indian plate northward subduction Xiecha the Ru Ouya plate and Tarim plate subducted to the south Kunlun mountains formed under. This form of plate motion triggered uplift effects may affect the the Yamane formation. <br> Despite this, the Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau Mount Kailash, the Kunlun Mountains towering mountain ranges but still. How they maintain live balanced? To uncover this mystery that needs further investigation and research. The high-tech climbing program jointly conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou University, State Seismological Bureau, Lanzhou Institute of Seismology, scientific research departments and tertiary institutions will gradually understood the reason.
