'cont'=>'July 3, 1898 (May 15), the Reform Movement, organic chemist Huangminglong was born. <br> Huangminglong (July 3, 1898 - 1979 Jul. 01 days), an organic chemist. Jiangsu Yangzhou. In 1917, graduated from Middle School, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang Hospital in 1918, graduated from the College. PhD in chemistry from the University of Berlin, Germany, in 1924. After returning home in 1925, he served as professor and chairman of Zhejiang Pharmaceutical College. (History cn) his motherland of Chinese medicine is considered a rich legacy of hope that modern science can be used to discover this treasure trove of Thus, in 1934, he again went to Germany in Berlin and took a year to do organic synthesis and analysis of the experiment, to learn new technology; 1935 into the education of the Institute of Chemistry, University of Wurzburg, Germany, where he studied under the famous alkaloid chemistry expert Bruchausen professor to study the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine and; 1938 after Germany&#39;s Schering-steroidal chemical synthesis, for the first time found that the reaction of diketene, for the production of female sex hormones. British secret was Seth Medical College, University of London (the l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) British study of female hormones. After returning home in 1940, he served as Academia Sinica researcher, Southwest Associated University. He studied the stereochemistry drive roundworm medicine research found the metamorphic Santonin four isomers in acid-base can be looped shift out of the mountains Road years and four metamorphic Santonin in, to infer the relative configuration. From from <br> 1945 to 1952, first in 1945, should be invited by the Harvard University chemist Fisher-steroidal Huangminglong a visiting professor at Harvard University, he served as Merck researcher. First arrived at Harvard, a time when the late World War II, Fisher still do war service work, study synthetic antimalarial. Naphthoquinone intermediates reduction experiment the Huangminglong in the use of \"wolf-kishner reduction, there was an accident, but he has not abandoned to their own, but continue to do so, the results are unexpectedly good, he carefully analyze the reasons creatively transform this reduction, achieved breakthrough results, the new method is named \"Huangminglong reduction, which is based on the Chinese scientists named the first case of the organic chemical reactions are included in the national organic chemistry textbooks. <br> returning in 1952, he served as chairman of the chemistry department of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army; Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1956, served as a researcher, Mathematical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences of the academician, vice chairman of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, leadership the synthesis of the seven-step method, and put into production to help the industrial sector. Leadership to the development of the family planning drugs, made a major contribution to the establishment of the steroidal drug industry. Research on the synthesis of steroidal and steroidal reaction, and in 1982 the second prize of the National Natural Science Award. Published more than 100 papers. <br> Huangminglong Third National People&#39;s Congress, the second, third and fifth members of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference. <br> Review: Huangminglong on reduction method is the reaction of organic chemistry in the history so far the only one named after the name of the Chinese people. <br>'
