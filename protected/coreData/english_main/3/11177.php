'cont'=>'(Oct. 14), Kang Xi, December 3, 1979 Coordinated Universal Time replace the time Greenwich quasi. at the World Administrative Radio Conference in Geneva in early <br> 1979, passed a resolution to determine the \"Coordinated Universal Time\" replace \"Greenwich Mean Time\" (lsjt.org) as the field of radio communications within international Standard Time. <br> GMT over the years that people are well-known international standard time and Coordinated Universal Time, why you want to switch to it? Simply put, Greenwich Mean Time is not precise enough. Greenwich time based on the Earth into a time scale, due to year fluctuations in the Earth&#39;s spin axis, resulting in time produced annually by nearly a second error. Therefore, in order to adapt to the development of modern science and technology, there is an urgent need to have a more accurate international standard time. Coordinated Universal Time is <br> the Earth relative to the volatility, the rotation rate of the shaft and the pole shift effect when the sun constantly corrected in a coordinated time. International Time Bureau adjusted twice a year, and through the standard time radio signal to the world around the emission standard time, so that you can for a second error GMT adjusted over. <br> Coordinated Universal Time began to use in the field of radio, aviation, marine, synchronous digital communication and Astronautical and so will have an important role. The adoption of this new international standard time, marking the rapid development of modern science and technology. <br>'
