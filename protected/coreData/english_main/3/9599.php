In 1900, a professor at the University of Berlin, Germany, Planck&#39;s first proposed quantum theory. December 14, 1906, Planck physics conference in Berlin entitled \"On the theory of normal spectral energy distribution law) papers, the famous Planck formula, this day is generally considered to be days of the birth of quantum physics. As early as in 1895, Planck, on the basis of many of the world&#39;s physicists studied the \"energy equipartition\" were. October 19, 1900, [history today www.lssdjt.com] Planck published research papers. After six years of research, he finally proposed a revolutionary hypothesis: a natural frequency of V linear harmonic oscillator, can only be made continuously or release energy, its energy value must be a minimum energy an integer number. The Planck these every little energy called quantum. (Lssdjt.com) This is the famous Planck&#39;s quantum hypothesis. Planck&#39;s quantum theory put forward, so that science are a new look in the world. 1858, Planck&#39;s death \"target =\" _blank \"> Planck was born in Kiel, Germany, a jurist family.
