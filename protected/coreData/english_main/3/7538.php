'cont'=>'(, Yam Tze June 24), August 3, 1972, Deng Xiaoping wrote a letter to Mao Zedong. August 3, 1972 letter to Mao Zedong <br> President <br> Deng Xiaoping the: <br> day before yesterday, (August 1) I am the fourth with all employees a listened to incriminating evidence about the Lin Piao anti counterrevolutionary clique of seditious conspiracy, and historical material on Chen Boda anti-communist activists, Trotskyist, traitors, spies, revisionist elements, so I feel more, if not the Cultural Revolution and the majority of in-depth mass movement side giant magic mirror, so quickly bunch of monsters and freaks of the prototype was to shine out, especially if not the President so that from their view of the world as well as their political views and conspiracy in a timely manner perceptible to their reactionary nature and great dangers and quickly put them exposed in broad daylight, once they fully grasp the supreme power of the party and the country, that not only our socialist motherland will become to the restoration of capitalism, and make our country fell into the re- semi-colonial point, I do not know how many head floor. No doubt, then, the people of the revolution and the real communists will eventually be up to them to overthrow, to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, but it has to go through how long painful history has repeatedly! Words Mindful of this, really shudder. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after the overthrow of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters of Liu Shaoqi, and overthrow the counterrevolutionary clique of Lin Biao, Chen Boda, again eliminating the greatest danger for the party and the country, so I can not help but cheer the Cultural Revolution of the great victory , the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Lin Biao and Chen Boda <br>, I do not what an important material came to light, in particular, I know nothing about their history, can only recall the usual feeling for them. <br> Lin Biao, I think he will fight, I do not believe what Yum General General of defeat is not, in fact, he did not win every battle, but that he is after all a military expert. He&#39;s quiet, and I think that is one of the strengths. In history, I know that he committed two errors, the time of the Long March, when he Peng Dehuai engage in an opposed the leadership of Chairman Mao, he has always been advertised themselves against Peng Dehuai, but in this very difficult moment, but alliance with Peng Dehuai, engage in secret series, If you do not have the prestige of the President and the strong leadership, I do not know what the situation. Once again the Korean War, which is a serious political juncture, he came forward to oppose the President of the extremely important political decisions, and refused to Korean war, supposedly he is more than Peng Dehuai to be a fit and proper person, and he refuses to, in essence, said, he is afraid of the United States, do not believe that will defeat U.S. imperialism, do not to believe just stand and own strength. These two things, until the Eleventh Plenary Session, in everyone&#39;s air of self-criticism, he casually said. <br> after the liberation of the country from some things I think he is a harbor jealousy and little guest, who gradually. [Lssjt.cn] This is seen from his attitude on of Luo Ronghuan and Liu Bocheng other comrades. Of Liu Bocheng comrades military academy teaching guidelines shortcomings and mistakes, criticism is should the, Lin Biao and Peng Dehuai Yikuai Liu&#39;s criticism is not with the human good of, forest enlarged CMC meeting speech more is the increased aid of, they even say Liu played what role in the Second Field did not, it seems that I am the only work there when I had this said, not as good cooperation commander, political commissar no role to play (I remember in the Standing Committee also said), my attitude, Lin Biao course, unhappy. Luo Ronghuan Comrade Lin Biao is old comrade-in-arms, supposedly they should be very good, Comrade Luo Ronghuan man&#39;s simple, sincere and kind, we know, Luo cadres prestige, Lin Biao said Shino cadres something find Luo, do not look for him. Can not remember Comrade Luo Ronghuan has pointed out in 1956 a few years, Lin Biao in the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, only emphasized three constantly read, Mao Zedong Thought vulgarization, Lin Biao was very upset from the Luo bad. On the Helong the relationship, we know. <br> handling Luo problem, I have a mistake. Before the the Luo problem out, I always thought the the Luo Lin Biao relationship is not bad, I have always felt that Luo Lin, old men, Luo when the total length is recommended Lin should be no problem, so, when one thousand nine hundred sixty-six the beginning of the year (December 1965), Lin Biao Luo problem is less serious in nature, and I feel very sudden. And Ye Qun described to me against Lin Biao and Luo how to attempt to seize power, but also tucked some Lo how to despise me, I&#39;m not comfortable to hear, I always feel that contains some personal things, how much in the way with some the nature of the surprise attack, which is how much influence I deal with the problem of Luo committed as the error can not be forgiveness. [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> Lin Biao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and now it seems he really is waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and is ready to seize power, subversion against the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism steps, but In the past I have always thought that he grasped the right, to grasp good, much better than I One of my biggest mistake of the past, is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. However, on two points in the past I have been not agree, one of Lin Biao and only emphasized three constantly read, has repeatedly said that as long as the three constantly read enough, I think that the Mao Zedong Thought is a comprehensive development in all areas of the Marxist-Leninist Marxism, they talk about three constantly read, not from all areas in the elaboration and application of Mao Zedong Thought, is equivalent to belittle the Mao Zedong Thought, Mao Zedong Thought vulgarization; First, the total feeling of Lin Biao formulation with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in isolation, The same is to belittle the significance of the Mao Zedong Thought, the detriment in particular the role of Mao Zedong Thought in the international communist movement and against the international revisionist movement, (lsjt.org) I learned this attitude from the Albanian comrades, I am in favor of Emphasizing the inheritance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, defend and develop the role. <br> for army building, I have always been certain that Lin Biao&#39;s role in this regard. I just felt that when he stressed that the decision factors, ignoring the military-technical and tactical training. The Lin Biao repeatedly said, as long as people are not afraid of death will win the war, this is correct, and one-sided. During the Cultural Revolution, I saw \"founded by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin direct command of this formulation, feel a bit harsh, I just feel that this is to improve the wording of the Lin Biao and prestige, not the other ideas now betrays itself, it suddenly dawned. <br> Chen Boda, his history I knew nothing about, and even write the Three Principles of the People in Yan&#39;an Introduction I do not know. Chan impression that this person is very conceited, very hypocritical, never self-criticism. He will write something, I have never heard him praised over others write good things. Others can write, he is jealous of, for example, Hu Qiaomu. He often mantra is \"I am a scholar, no, this is the only self-criticism. He looked down he was involved in the article or file. If he raised incorrect views, while the later is critical, he said that is no longer, and never heard him say that he made a mistake in that thing. For example, he said that is not good for industrial seventy, whether he does not agree on what it? Heard he said. I only know that he made in the industrial aspects of the two propositions, one is engaged in trusts, one is to engage in piecework system. Engage in trust, we have tried, this means that the industry is more concentrated, there is a great contradiction for the play of the principle of local enthusiasm. Engage in piecework system (his purpose in Tianjin. Investigative material) will mean further engage the material incentives, it is certainly not as good as hourly wages and piecework wages combined system. After he did not say that these two things. As he made seventy bad, the central has specified that he is responsible for modifying, but then I also reminders him a few times, he always delay not to engage in, I do not know what drugs he sells gourd. A number of articles written criticism of Soviet revisionism, because it is written by a team of Comrade Kang Sheng, Chen Boda has not been interested in participating. Only engaged in the international communist movement twenty-five specified he presided modify only positive. In short, the kind of thing, there are many details can not remember. Chen Boda years presided over what him such a grip pen, to forgive, so only general my impression of him. As he presided in the Cultural Revolution in the things, in particular, is the ninth of the Second Plenary Session of things, just in listening to the central file to convey a villain like him, before we know the past, the kind of show is not anything strange. The Chairman of <br> know, Lin Biao, Chen Boda, to the home of the resurrection fast. If it is not the protection of the President, I do not know will become what it was like. <br> the whole Party and the people I work enthusiastically celebrated after the of Liu Shaoqi counterrevolutionary bourgeois headquarters is destroyed, (Lssdjt.com) and destroyed the great victory of the Lin Piao anti counterrevolutionary clique! <br> ; <br> about myself, my mistakes and sins, in June and July 1968, wrote \"readme recognize myself made a review. Up to now, I still recognize the entire contents of my review, and reaffirmed the central guarantee to never reverse the verdict. I <br> history of one of the biggest mistakes in the early 1931 should not have to leave the Red Seven Army Although this behavior is a legitimate organization, but in the political extremes wrong. <br> in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, I basically executed Chairman Mao&#39;s correct line, of course made some individual errors. <br> another of my biggest mistakes, to work in Beijing, especially after I served as the CPC Central Committee general secretary, made a series of errors, has been developed to the implementation of a counter-revolutionary one with Liu Shaoqi bourgeois reactionary routes. The work of the General Secretary, I make very bad, not often consult the report to the President, the error committed to engage an independent kingdom. Difficult period in the six ¡ð, in 2061, I did not boycott the Three-Self unhealthy trend of a package of four free capitalism, not in accordance with Chairman instructed to grasp the basic construction of the three-wire, so that should not dismount dismounted, postponed a three-line construction of great strategic significance. In industrial construction, I presided engage in industrial seventy, there is no politics in command, not the President of the Angang Constitution as a pointer, so it is something wrong. In the organization, I was wrong and trust these people of Peng Zhen, Luo Yang Shangkun. Particularly significant is the long-term I did not hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to expose me and criticize me, should be completely, it is also a save for me personally. I fully support the President&#39;s words: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is absolutely necessary, very timely. <br> I made a lot of errors, account readme, here is no longer listed. My source of error the bourgeois worldview has not been fundamentally transform and divorced from the masses from the actual results. [1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> November last year (1971) I presented to the President of the proposed request for work. I know this: after making a mistake, I completely out of work, divorced from social contact has more than five years for almost six years, I always want to have a chance to correct their mistakes from work, back to the President of the proletarian revolution The route up. I am fully aware that, like I committed a great error and sin, batch smelly people in the community, no longer possible to get the trust of the masses is impossible to make any important work. However, I think his body better, have 68, you can also make some of the technical nature of the work (research work), also the party for the people, for the work in 2078, in order to make up too in case. I do not, I wait for the instructions of the President and the Central. sincerely Sincerely <br> <br> President Wanshouwujiang! <br> the Deng Xiaoping <br> August 3, 1972 <br> Reviews : rolling in the Yangtze River eastward, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) spray depleted hero <br>'
