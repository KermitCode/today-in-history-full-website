'cont'=>'December 3, 2004 (Jiashen October 22), the death of the international mathematical dean Shen Chern. <br> Shen Chern (October 28, 1911 - 2004 December 3), Han nationality, native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Chinese-American, International Mathematics Masters, well-known educator, the CAS foreign academicians , \"into the wonderful mathematical garden,\" the founder of the 20th century, a world-class geometer. Boyhood that reveals mathematical talent, several mathematical career choices, and strive to climb, and eventually became brilliant. His outstanding contribution in the overall differential geometry, affect the development of mathematics as a whole, Chen Ning Yang hailed Following Euclid, Gauss, Riemann, the Cartan another milestone figure. Has chaired the founder of three Institute of Mathematics, has created a team of world-renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau, Wu Wenjun, Liao, Cheng Shiu Yuen waiting scholars have under the tutelage of Chern. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) In 1911, October 28, 2010 Born in the Zhejiang Jiaxing Xiu Water County. Show the state high school graduation in 1922, came to Tianjin. [TodayinHistory.cn] 1923 years into the Rotary Secondary School (now Tianjin Railway). Graduation in 1926, into the Department of Mathematics, Nankai University, graduating in 1930, a bachelor&#39;s degree. Into Tsinghua University, Assistant Professor same year, a graduate student in 1931, under the tutelage of differential geometry in China pioneer Sun Guangyuan study projective differential geometry in 1934 graduated with a master degree, as China&#39;s own culture first mathematics graduate. <br> 1934 years of Chinese Culture and Education Foundation Scholarship (some say funded under the Tsinghua University), went to the University of Hamburg, Germany, under the tutelage of the famous geometer Brushy open (Blaschke), 1936 was a Doctor of Science degree; graduate scholarship there is a surplus, the same year in summer funded by the Chinese Culture Foundation, so he transferred to Paris, France follow Cartan (E.Cartan) study of differential geometry. War with the school after <br> 1937 summer left France after the United States to return home, Shen Chern served as a professor at Tsinghua University; moved to Kunming, Yunnan, teaching differential geometry at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, joint Southwest Associated University. <br> 1943, the American mathematician Veblen (O.Veblen), was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. After two years, he completed the most important work in the life: proof of high-dimensional Gaussian - state within formula (Gauss-Bonnet Formula), constructed nowadays commonly used in Chen characteristic classes (some say Chen characteristic class), as laid the foundation for global differential geometry. <br> 1946 victory of the war, he returned to Shanghai, presided over the work of the Institute of Mathematics, Academia Sinica, the next two to three years, he trained a group of young topologists. In early 1949, the Academia Sinica relocated to Taiwan, Shen Chern Ying, director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Oppenheimer invited the family moved to the United States. Summer of 1949 at the University of Chicago, succeeded professorships in EPLane; mentors mentors Sun Guangyuan EPLane precisely Chern year studying in the United States; This is the revival of the United States Differential geometry has made important contributions. In 1960, Chern was employed as a professor of the University of California, Berkeley, until his retirement in 1980. Elected in 1961 as the Academy of Sciences of the United States, from 1963 to 1964, then U.S. Vice-Chairman of the Mathematical Society. Shen Chern in his later years an important contribution to build based purely mathematical United States National Institute of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1981, he is the first director. The Today www.TodayOnHistory.com [history] In 1984 retirement, Shen Chern successively employed as Peking University, Honorary Professor of Nankai University. In 1985, employed by the Ministry of Education of the People&#39;s Republic of China (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) served as the director of the Institute of Mathematics, Nankai. In the same year the Nankai University awarded him an honorary doctorate. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> since 1986, the Chinese mathematics will be set up and contractors \"Shen Chern Prize in Mathematics. <br> Beijing time on December 3, 2011 19, 2004 14 points, Shen Chern died in the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. Bad news came of the death of Mr. Chen Xingshen, Nankai plunged into grief. Nankai students spontaneously gathered to the new lake, lit candlelight tribute to such a great noble alumni. The Nankai set the hall, huge crowds come to pay. The scene was so touching. <br>'
