'cont'=>'(Awake March 23), May 3, 1994, the advent of the world&#39;s first genetically modified rice in Hefei, Anhui. <br> 1994, the advent of the world&#39;s first genetically modified rice in Hefei, Anhui Province. (Lsjt.org) researchers of the Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei Branch of ion beam mediated method where the first international joint research for many years bred with Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Upon examination proved the outer gene genetic offspring. This major breakthrough is directed breeding opened up a new path. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> experts, through the purpose gene transfer, genetic improvement of species directed, is a popular high-tech fields in today&#39;s life science research. Institute of Plasma Physics, one of the main units of the thermonuclear fusion and plasma physics research in China, this by researchers in the international early 1980s pioneered the ion beam biological breeding methods, made a series of achievements, the scope of the study is extended to a lot of grain, cotton, and microbial. <br> transgenic rice is a Ph.D. graduate research projects conducted under the careful guidance of mentor Xu Zhihong, implantation, Ng Ka Road. They punch on the seed with a low energy ion beam, pierced seed sheath and the cell wall, and then the selected transfer substance with known genetic characteristics of gene fragment is integrated into the genome of the seed cells, with an ion beam, so that the The seeds have been transferred material already certain genetic characteristics. They bred genetically modified rice, the molecular level detection and a variety of methods to detect, prove exogenous gene has indeed measured rice gene exists, and the trait is genetic. <br> It is understood that, in Japan, Australia and other developed countries have started to carry out large-scale studies of ion beam breeding. <br>'
