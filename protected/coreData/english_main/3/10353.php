According to the original plan, the commission of inquiry after three months, that is, to the government on October 23 to submit its final report, but because of disagreement within the Commission of Inquiry, the report released forced to postponed twice. the riots indeed <br> 5 premeditated <br> November 3, the Indonesian Ministry of Justice building, hundreds of reporters were waiting eagerly for the joint fact-finding committee responsible for investigating the riots in May announced the final investigation report. After about five hours, the joint fact-finding committee in the absence of ministerial-level officials in all six should be the scene by the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry Marzuki - Darusman told the press published the entire contents of the report. Some speculations about the riots truth about May of this year, report to the people confirmed that the May riots is indeed a well-organized and planned the riots, and targets mainly ethnic Chinese riots occurred during and after, did occur appalling mass rape of Chinese women event. (Lsjt.org) <br> report is divided into nine sections 28, answered the attention of several problems. First of all, the report proved to be the May riots organized and well-planned. Joint fact-finding committee to focus on the outbreak of the city of Jakarta, six riot investigation, the riot mode is basically the same as are inciting start from someone, then appeared the crowd was looted and burned shops, the report will be involved in personnel are divided into the instigators of the riots, positive the participant and negative participants. Instigators multi riots outside the stranger, obviously specially trained transport motorcycles, cars and jeeps, and communication tools, mobile phone and walkie-talkie. The instigator often in arouse the emotions of the masses, and started looting and damage to buildings, organized evacuation and seditious activities continue to go to another one. Cited by the report on the riots loss of material shows that the most serious property damage in the riots is Chinese. The material published by the humanitarian volunteer organization in Jakarta, a total of 1190 people were burned to death in the riots, 27 people were killed with a weapon, 91 people were injured. armed forces <br> alleged rape <br> Secondly, the report confirmed that the events of the most controversial in the riot investigation, a large number of ethnic Chinese women were subjected to mass rape cases that really happened, Defense Minister Wiranto, the police chief and period, the the intelligence total length of the Commission of Inquiry to investigate the repeated public speech, denied that there was conclusive evidence that the violence in cases of rape during the riots, caused fierce debate Indonesian society from top to bottom. According to the final report of the Commission of Inquiry, May 13 -15, 2011 during the riots in Jakarta, a total of 52 women were raped, 14 women were raped and abuse, 10 were victims of sexual assault or child paternity, nine were subject to sexual humiliation, The survey report also found that rape in different regions almost simultaneously, and more for the collective rape, which the vast majority of the victims were ethnic Chinese, the report of the Commission of Inquiry in particular criticized the armed forces failed to take effective measures to stop the riots, but also hinted that the former President of the Soviet Union Hutto&#39;s son-in-law, Prabowo Army Strategic Forces led by its direct descendant of special forces suspected of involvement in the case of a raped Chinese women in May, and in various organizations inciting unrest. The report concludes that (history com) riot triggered a political high-level power struggle due to the economic crisis worsened, some people with ulterior motives in an attempt to establish the extra-constitutional powers by creating social chaos,. Therefore, the investigation committee asked the Government to be able to continue in-depth investigation of the true intent of the Strategic Reserve Command, a high-ranking officers meeting held on May 14, held Prabowo and then Jakarta military commander Xia Fuli Major General and others throughout the riots during responsibility. investigation committee <br> Finally, to the government of the eight recommendations, including continuing to investigate the riots in the causes and severely punish the murderers, the primary responsibility for Prabowo and Xia Fuli sent to the military court, asking the Government to legislation to protect safety of witnesses and victims, to restore the reputation of the riot victims and their families, and pay damages. <br> military Executive has the defense <br> investigation reports by the media after the announcement, immediately aroused strong repercussions in the Indonesian domestic. people <br> support of the Commission of Inquiry report strongly urge the Government to continue to investigate and to lay bare the truth of riots. State exhortations party chairman May \"democratic revolution\" spiritual leader Amin - Rais said the government should stand on the side of the people, to try those involved in the riots. Former cabinet ministers, leaders of the current national unity and justice movement Saar the Vonnoh also believe that the Government must take immediate action to face the joint fact-finding investigation report of the Committee as an official survey organization, or the government will face a serious crisis of confidence. The Indonesia public opinion generally praised the results of the work of the Commission of Inquiry, and hope that the Government will further investigate and punish the masterminds. <br> reaction from the Indonesian government, however, very reluctantly, the report of the Commission of Inquiry or criticism, or refute, or silence, and even expressed doubts about the authenticity of the report. November 4, Defense Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Wiranto publicly for the military defense to refute the Commission of Inquiry on suspected army&#39;s involvement in the analysis of the riots, pointed out that the only general regular meeting of the Strategic Reserve Force officers&#39; meeting held on May 14, did not involve any criminal action and subversive actions, he also criticized the commission of inquiry should be made similar conclusions, but should provide concrete evidence of the fact, but at last he also expressed respect for the work of the Commission of Inquiry, and promised to take concrete steps to continue the investigation stick to it, the intelligence chief of the armed forces issued a statement, denied that the riots that occurred during the mass rape incident, but the armed forces will continue to study and investigate the truth, until November 10, the direct person in charge of the investigation committee - Indonesian President Ha Bibi has not been on this issue a formal position. Just ask the six ministers to discuss the content of the report and research. still the story behind <br> report public opinion in <br>, investigation report confirmed the existence of rape, but the in riots degree intentional made downplayed. The content and conclusions of the report at the same time, there are many obscure traces, apparently the result of compromise within the Commission of Inquiry, or by outside pressures. For example, the survey reports of large-scale collective rape of Chinese women cases occurred in recognizing May while, but stresses that there is sufficient evidence to show that rape is organized; background and motivation for the riot, but also make people feel & ldquo difficulties; Unspoken \". In the number of women victims, the figures published by the Commission of Inquiry is a far cry from the figures released by some human rights organizations, according to Indonesian and international relief organizations estimated the May riots in Chinese women being raped at least 160 to 180, of which 20 people have died. According to the analysis, there are two reasons for this digital divide: One is the rape of women and their families, life safety and reputation had been unwilling to report, the situation is almost as witnesses; Indonesia May riots later, the situation has not been able to restore calm to a variety of violent killings, the victims or their families have been repeatedly intimidation. Meanwhile, some government military and political officials also expressed their support to deny the authenticity of the rape in May, so that victims and witnesses lost their sense of trust on the government forensics work of the Commission of Inquiry, which largely hindered. In October, Jakarta urban bizarre burglary murder, killed a responsible woman volunteers to help female victims of the May riots restore mental health, afterwards, the police will be the case as an ordinary robbery homicide This thing has virtually aggravated the May riots psychological burden for victims and witnesses to uncover the truth. <br>'
