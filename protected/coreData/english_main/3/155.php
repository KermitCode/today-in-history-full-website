'cont'=>'Twelfth lunar month, the first two days) (Gengxu years, January 3, 1851, Foucault, French physicist confirmed that the Earth&#39;s rotation. <br> 1851 January 3, 2010, (lssjt.cn) Foucault, French physicist, designed to put on a large confirm the Earth&#39;s rotation. The Foucault pendulum length of 67 meters, and the pendulum is a mass of 28 kg iron ball. Placed in the gravity and the suspension wire under tension in the vicinity of its vertical position vibration. Foucault&#39;s experiment directly verify the rotation of the earth, it was awarded five Medal of Honor Knight. <br> 1852 24, Foucault, French physicist trial to the success of the world&#39;s first gyroscope. The state funeral in Paris hospital in 1851, Fu Kecheng successfully with pendulum demonstrates the Earth&#39;s rotation experiment. Foucault pendulum experiment, in 1852, he produced a gyroscope (gyro) - is modern aviation, the predecessor of the inertial guidance devices used by the military field. The gyroscope principle is: the direction of the rotation axis of a rotating object referred without outside influence, will not change. Great development since the seventies of the last century, the gyroscope, fiber optic gyroscopes, laser resonator gyro, one after another, these modern gyroscope has a compact structure, high sensitivity and reliable working advantages in many The field has been completely replaced the traditional mechanical gyroscopes, the key components in the modern navigation equipment. <br> traditional mechanical gyroscope <br> of Foucault (1819 to 1868), the French experimental physicist, was born in Paris on September 18, 1819. Childhood that created activities like exquisitely hand. Due to the determination of the speed of light by a doctorate in physics in 1853, and Napoleon III appointed professor of physics at the Paris Observatory. Because he learned before, there are a number of inventions, and therefore favored by the national scientific community and in 1864 was elected a member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1868, he was elected to the Paris Academy of Sciences. February 11, 1868, died in Paris, aged 49 years old. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br>'
