'cont'=>'August 3, 1958 (June 18), the Reform Movement, manufactured in the United States, a nuclear submarine \"Nautilus\" through the Arctic. 03 days - <br> 1958 08 first nuclear submarine \"Nautilus\", manufactured in the United States through the ice floes of the Arctic. Arctic channel open. (Today in History cn Precision constructed) <br> nautilus also a creature of the miracle. The human mimic the Nautilus drainage, absorbent floating, sinking, produced the first submarine. (History. Cn) 1954 was born the world&#39;s first nuclear-powered submarine \"Nautilus\", \"Nautilus\" total weight of 2,800 tons, a total cost of $ 55,000,000. The entire hull is 90 meters long, Speed &#8203;&#8203;average 20, maximum speed of 25 knots at maximum service speed continuous sailing 50 days, the entire 30,000 km without the need to add any fuel. Ordinary submarines of the boat and then compared to the speed of about half. The entire nuclear power plant accounts for about half of the hull. Hull shape and internal power instrument with combat equipment, are the most sophisticated scientific products, with the most streamlined appearance and easy to control assembly are up, compared with ordinary submarine \"Nautilus\" hull even more thick shell, diving depth of 150 meters below the road in the deep, by virtue of their special equipment, sonar, free to Pathfinder, no running aground the risk of collision stone. <br> <br> <br> parrot goose Luo Hao (Nautilus) nuclear submarine <br> years January 21, l954, the first human one The nuclear-powered submarine \"Nautilus\" was launched in the cheers of 10,000 spectators. Through the efforts of the \"Nautilus\" be completed in this year. In theory, it can be underwater maximum speed continuous sailing 50 days, the range of 30,000 sea miles without having to add any fuel. The boat is also equipped with a self-guided torpedoes. 17, <br> 1955 \"Nautilus\", the first trials, the first nuclear-powered submarine in the history of mankind officially began to roam the oceans. Its first captain Wilkinson the (Eugene P.Wilkinson) naval lieutenant colonel. In May, the \"Nautilus\" was more than 90 hours underwater voyage test 1 3 8 l nautical miles voyage was conventionally powered submarine voyage nine times. It is also the average speed of 20 to complete the 1397 sea miles sailing between from ·ðÂÞÀï´ï»ùÎ¤ Manchester to New London. <br> until April 1957 for the first time to replace the fuel rods into the water from the January 21, l954 years, \"Nautilus\", the total range of up to 62,526 sea miles, consuming only a few kilograms of uranium. If conventional submarines sailing at the same speed the same distance, will consume about 8,000 tons of fuel oil. \"Nautilus\", also arrived at the North Pole for the first time underwater vehicle known. \"The great charm of the nuclear submarine Nautilus\" show does not stop there. According to the United States disclosed, since its service, use it many times unspoken - of ship confrontation as well as anti-submarine exercises. In July and August, l955, \"Nautilus\" first war exercises, it easily beat the anti-submarine fleet, including an anti-submarine aircraft carrier at the maneuvers, \"Nautilus\", a total of \"sunk\" seven \"enemy\". Subsequent exercises of NATO organization called \"counter-attack\" by the \"Nautilus\" attack surface ships to reach l 6 vessels, including two aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers l vessels and destroyers 9, the remaining four for oil tankers and cargo ships. (History www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> According to U.S. statistics, the \"Nautilus\" suffered in the previous exercises, more than 5,000 attacks. According to conservative estimates, the conventionally powered submarines, which will be sunk 300 times, \"Nautilus\" only three times, the nuclear submarine \"Nautilus\" show indeed indestructible combat into force. <br> Today, when we look back on the Cold War can be seen, the face of the powerful U.S. Navy carrier battle group as the core, is less than the United States, in its own economic and technological strength, geopolitical environment in poor circumstances, the Soviet Union The reason why great efforts to develop nuclear submarines, can not fail to mention the \"Nautilus\" He Yiqi shown to the opponent, and the significance of this revelation, even now still seems not to be underestimated. the advent of <br> \"Nautilus\" has immeasurably huge value, its political and military implications are profound. But the boat primarily for the purposes of the test, so there is no build a successor to the boat. The the boat l 980 years and retired as a memento of the boat in its birthplace Groton permanent preservation. <br> parrot goose Luo Hao (Nautilus) nuclear submarine <br> <br> Comments: The world&#39;s first battery submarines and a The nuclear submarine named Nautilus visible Nautilus is the key to open the submarine idea. <br>'
