On <br> 8 12, the Comrade Luo memorial meeting was held in the capital of the Great Hall of the People, Ye Jianying, presided over a memorial ceremony, [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] Deng Xiaoping eulogy. the <br> \"People&#39;s Daily\" published August 11, 1978 (history today www.lssdjt.com) People&#39;s Liberation Army generals Yang Dezhi written article \"outstanding leadership of this great warrior - mourning Luo comrades . Which talked about: the way to Beijing, I thought, must go to visit to Beijing, Luo comrades. Who had been subjected to Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\" cruel persecution of the distinguished leaders of our military, my old heads, old comrades. Not found Luo comrades on the phone, I am deeply sorry, and heart to wish him a speedy return to health, and leadership that we are a big step forward in the march on the road. But had no idea how came the unexpected bad news - Luo comrades died! Suddenly, I was overcome with grief, feeling a long time difficult to calm. <br> in this time of sorrow, I could not help but think of the past decade, Luo comrades adversity Eritrea encounter. Lin Biao for Cuandangduoquan ambition of Comrade Luo as obstacles, manufacturing all kinds of charges, brutal persecution. We Luo comrades, strong and revolutionary will, withstand how much devastation and torment! The the Lin Biao self after the explosion, the Luo comrades suffered by Chen Yuan should have been righted, but the \"Gang of Four\" and still take advantage of every opportunity to attack him, falsely accused him. The traitor Jiang Qing irresponsible remarks, at a meeting openly named a legion of cadres bad. I remember the spring of this year, his passing Wuhan, also confidently said that the struggle for the early realization of the four modernizations, building a strong socialist country. Their dreams, the disease claimed his life. This is our party and army how significant loss! <br> the past few days, my ear dirge low? h, heart grief linger, Comrade Luo of voice and facial expression, as if still present. I will never forget the first time I saw his scene. It was the fall of 1929, Guangdong and Jiangxi junction Hutoushan Workers &#39;and Peasants&#39; Red Army when the Guangdong warlord Jitang forces combat. After fighting troops collection in a recently harvested rice fields. Saw came a dressed in civilian clothes, wearing shorts under 20 years old handsome youth, this is the first came to our five detachment Party Luo comrades. He strode to the front of the queue, and humbly said: \"I just returned from the white area, not yet familiar with the Red Army, and later with the struggle, a lot of help. \"He added: We are a team of workers and peasants, and to strengthen the leadership of the party, to do a good job in the unity of the officers and men to improve the combat effectiveness of troops. ... His call to action language, every word falls on the heart of the comrades, Beng starting point point spark. Since then, I have a long time fighting and work under the leadership of Comrade Luo. <br> in the two-line struggle within the Party, Comrade Luo stand firm, clear-cut, bravely defend Chairman Mao&#39;s thoughts and route. When bourgeois careerist, conspirator Lin Biao wantonly implementation of the counterrevolutionary revisionist line, the aggressive pursuit of bourgeois politics, simply do not speak to the military training, Comrade Luo be resolutely resisted. Consistency of Chairman Mao&#39;s military thought and the situation at home and abroad, with great vigor, organization, leadership the mass training campaign 1964. He went to the troops, found cultivate the typical convene site meetings. Less than six months from June to October this year, he twice in person, Shandong, check the training of troops and militia to watch military performances, pointed out: \"The soldiers are excel like this on any enemy in the world. do nothing. \"For military training, instructions: to engage in the popularity of\", \"to pay attention to work and rest, combine the revolutionary spirit and the spirit of science\", \"Do not abuse the enthusiasm of the crowd, abuse enthusiasm of the masses. \" Later, he organized the the Beijing troops and the Jinan Military military performances, reporting to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou Enlai and Zhu Peng, was highly commended. Training campaign this year due to the careful organization of the Luo comrades, and greatly improve the combat effectiveness of the troops, become a glorious page in the history of our military troop training. <br> from the first time I saw Luo comrades, I have this impression: he attaches great importance to the army&#39;s political work, with in-depth practical work style of hard struggle. In the difficult war years, every time the march, his tall figure always go, bypassing the big step, and comrades in the ranks of the soldiers, like hiking through the water, and he&#39;s riding on the organization, always give The wounded and sick riding. He is familiar with the military situation, in-depth practical understanding of the wishes and demands of the soldiers. Playing in Ji&#39;an, I was Command Soldier Chairman. The day of the liberation of Ji&#39;an, let me buy two Koyo seeds and cigarettes, a celebration, and on behalf of all of us to please the division political commissar Luo comrades, he did indeed come to participate in our celebration, also spoke. To the war of liberation, he has the political commissar of the Corps, but still often go to the troops and authorities to go on the troops combat, training, and life, are very clear. In the front line, we sometimes live in a house, the bed next to the bed, talking about words very intimate. Talk to him cadres, to talk about the soldiers, talk about the ideological trend of troops, less specific, less detailed, is really admirable. the <br> National liberation, he was to maintain that kind of style of war. He served as chief of the general staff, participate in various activities to deal with the day-to-day affairs, the work is heavy, but he still managed to take time out, to the troops to grassroots levels, to inspect and guide the work. <br>'
