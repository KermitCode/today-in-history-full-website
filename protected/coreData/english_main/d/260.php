'cont'=>'January 8 -87 years (Imjin the twelfth lunar month 12), the death of the Han dynasty. the <br> Han dynasty (156 years BC, July 14 / August 10 - BC March 1987 29 May 2099 ago), China&#39;s Western Han emperor (141 BC - before reigned 87 years) <br> public mused An, Ho seeing of late - Han Wudi express demand for talents; General, minions of the country ...... rate of the three services of the heart, the same soldiers of force, so the anger-shaped thousands of miles and be thunderstruck, Wei Zhen everything volts - Han Wudi generals pesticides unauthorized killings reported anger forgiveness; determined by Ershi defeat did Sgt death, discrete grief, often in Zhen Xin ...... today&#39;s Service in the ban harsh storm, ended trespassing ode to force the farmers to repair horse complex, so in order to fill a vacancy, not lack of armaments. - Han Wudi aging \"Luntai regret Chao\" said the longer lightly soldiers things <br> Western Han dynasty Chinese feudal dynasty in the history of the first golden age, which lasted 210 years, the the Han Wudi exclusive 55-year period of his rule is the golden age of the Western Han Dynasty. Look at the surrounding areas of China, is still a wilderness, Emperor Wu of the Han Chinese, is in the political, economic, cultural and other aspects very mature countries. Any reign for more than half a century, the emperor must be left in the history of their own deep imprint Han Wudi its sanguine create the type of character, so that his 55 years as long and there is no lack of exciting history paragraph. <br> Han Wudi name Liu Che little life Liu grunter, posthumous title Takatake emperor, bearing the name of King Sejong. As emperor, he is a lucky guy. He is this non-heir-apparent, but his mother Wang Gong Wei struggle to beat the other concubines made a Queen&#39;s throne, then child with your mother, became Prince. Han emperor of his great-grandfather as he lay north of the Great Wall, south Nanling, east to the sea, rivers, mountains in west Sichuan Gansu, recuperate implementation of the Han emperor, Emperor Wen of Han and father, his grandfather, the accumulation of half a century makes money tired giant million \",\" Taicang of millet filled gel product, it is in this context, the 15-year-old Liu Che inherited throne of the Han Dynasty. But the reign of Emperor Wudi six years ago, under the shackles of the governance of the Group in the the Dou Taihuang his grandmother, the Queen Mother, led by advocating Huanglao inaction can not fully display their abilities and ambitions, until 135 BC truly become masters of the country. <br> Huns from the founding of the early years of the Western Han had already become a scourge of the Central Plains, fight the Huns has been one of the basic national policy of Han Wudi. Han Wudi total organization up to 16 times Huns war, 127 years BC Battle of Henan captured the Hetao Plain, Changan eliminates the direct threat of the Huns, the first 121 years of the Battle of the Hexi wrest from Lanzhou up large tracts of land in Lop Nur in Xinjiang, Han Chinese sphere of influence extends into the Western Regions, the pour-nation force attack, 119 years before Mobei Battle inline Huns heart, seal wolf ranking Xu, from \"Monan Wang Ting & rdquo ;. Wei Qing, Huo the humble outstanding generals growth in the heroic age, they become a symbol of the spirit of the Han Dynasty \". The victory of the developed culture of the Han Dynasty backward nomadic Huns victory for human civilization, and civilization are better able to develop and spread. <br> Han Wudi martial arts is by no means limited to war against the Huns. In the South, he has eliminated the three countries Minyue Ouyue, South Vietnam, to the southeast of the Vietnamese family areas included in the Han Dynasty territory. In the Southwest, he sent such as Sima phase as to pacify Chief of force coercion, conquered the local uncivilized Yelang other nationalities. In the Northeast, he conquered the ancient Korean state. But the greater significance is the hole through the Western Regions. Cut off Hun right arm, he sent Zhang Qian to the Western Regions as an envoy, who the history of China&#39;s first great explorers after twice unimaginable trudged, finally opened up channels between the civilizations of Central Asia and East Asia Han civilization This is also the eastern section of the Silk Road. Avenue in a thousand years time thereafter has been the main road of China and West Asia and Europe cultural exchanges, Buddhism Avenue incoming papermaking, the compass also came out this channel (notwithstanding list of emperors \"Marine Silk Road\", but its role is difficult with the overland Silk Road compared), the only virtue, Emperor Wudi enough to be discharged into the world in men. Subsequently, the Han Dynasty through pacify mainly used along with the means of force gradually the sphere of influence of Western Han Dynasty, but Dawan war were stained with the blood of the two peoples, Han Wan <br> Han Wudi posthumous Wu, but his achievements sandwiches aspects by no means inferior. His throne early years, they adopted the recommendations of the Dong Zhongshu \"to abandon 100, Only Confucianism\" Confucian in his reign did not truly become one, but continue to strengthen under his successor who, finally be the overriding ideological system, in-depth to every Chinese person&#39;s bone marrow, and suppress the development of other ideas. He established the Imperial College, this is the start of the official school of Chinese history. He established Yuefu this poetic form is an important stage of development of Chinese literature. He sent Deng equality to develop a Taichu calendar. <br> Emperor Wu of Han Chinese history, there is a very important point, is to strengthen the centralization of power. (On com) an important policy of his cut-fan, he adopted Zhu Fuyan claims, the implementation of the \"push-En Order, the princes of the territory the more points the smaller, weaker princes no longer has Central contend ability. He ordered five baht money unified, the coinage power is centralized, the turn Yantie exclusivity nationalized, adoption of Sang Hongyang advocated the establishment of a levelized official price control by the government, engaged in the trading (of course, this a clear violation of the measures of economic laws, in successive years of military forces, the treasuries deficit expedient). Emperor Wudi of the authority of the emperor personal development to the extreme, the subjects have the right of life or death. <br> sanguine create the Han Wudi life exploits battered, but he&#39;s a second campaign and massive construction projects exhausted early Han generations lay up, despite the minister Sang Hongyang total good at money-making, but still caught in the huge fiscal deficit. Late in life, his suspicion and tyranny finally causing Witchcraft, the capital of a bloody Many people, including the Queen, Prince, Princess, the prime minister With his resentment wronged and died, which prompted his later years, under the crime The edict admitted no fault of their own, that is no longer active military forces, will focus on the people&#39;s livelihood. <br> Emperor Wu of Han and Qin Shi Huang, affect far more than the dynasties of emperors, continued to affect the two thousand years of Chinese ideology and culture, political system, territory. He and Qin Shi Huang, the comparison is very interesting, the two have much in common, have a good conquest, good parade, good suspicion good ZhuSha, civil, good fairy. Qin Shi Huang unified the Central Plains re-caught in the split, but after a short time, the early Han Dynasty, although the return to dominate, but vassal state of great force, not a small split hidden Han Wudi finally established a centralized and Qin Shi Huang to get off leave the pieces, and even some never made the region part of China&#39;s territory; Qin Shi Huang unified text, currency, weights and measures, the Han Dynasty attempts the unification of China in culture and ideology. From this perspective, the Han Dynasty of Qin Shi Huang cause inherited and carried forward by Han Wudi to go further than the First Emperor, but taking into account the the Han Wudi exploits after all is built on the basis of the emperor&#39;s, and his impact on history should be slightly lower than the Qin Shi Huang. Han Wudi&#39;s ranking in the charts below the emperor, but living in the other top Chinese emperors. the <br> Comment: Han Wudi in the political, cultural implementation of the historical role of the \"universal\" be questioned, but his attack Huns, defend advanced farming cultural circle and drilled straight through the \"Silk Road East the historical merits are undisputed. Han Wudi young age wise, in stark contrast with his older Hunkui history emperors enjoy unlimited authority time is too long, often fail to maintain a rational and objective thinking of running the country, it is a typical example of Emperor Wudi.
