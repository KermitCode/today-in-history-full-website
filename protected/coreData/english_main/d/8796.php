(lssdjt.cn) <br> Although the Qin Dynasty only continues 15 years, but the reigning paradigm established by Qin Shi Huang has been continue. Qin Shi Huang in China more than 2,000 years centralized feudal monarchy of the main designers of the breadth and depth of the impact is difficult compared to any other emperors emperor&#39;s many initiatives are successful is through still controversial, but this does not affect the Qin Shi Huang&#39;s ranking in the championship, because the book ranking is based on the positive impact and the negative impact of the absolute value of the sum of <br> the history of the world, creating a huge empire many emperors, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) but they are in the chart&#39;s rankings are not as Qin Shi Huang. because both Cyrus, Caesar or Alexander the Great, they establish the empire is long gone, and even in the era of their reign, the reorganization of the empire unity is far less than the Emperor Qin empire founded by Qin Shi Huang (Chinese Empire), in spite of the changes, but it lasted a thousand years old. <br> Qin Shi Huang is basically just an impact of China&#39;s emperors, but among the many world impact of emperors before him in the championship, this is because the far-reaching and time long impact of the First Emperor of China, on the other hand, the Chinese population history has been accounted for more than 20% of the world&#39;s population, China has an important impact important influence (Mike Hart language) can be regarded as the world, but also due to the centralization of power and loyalty to the emperor thought, much larger than the impact of the emperors in Chinese history. many other countries.
