Bravery inherent temperament of a good education with the Macedonians together, together with his father to bring his strong will and infinite ambition, is the root of his stunning dominance he was 16 years old his father at age four expeditions, until his 20-year-old throne, has a rich combat experience, military commander. <br> of the Alexander with lightning speed repression the Greek polis uprising led to Thebes, Bisi Yi the bottom to the ground after solid rear, began a mighty Oriental conquer the Persian Empire is the enemies of the years of the Greek city-states to attack Persia, is also the best way to consolidate the unity of Greece. <br> 334 BC, Alexander led the infantry 30000 Cavalry 5000 into Asia Minor (in the East at the time, this is not really a huge army). Glasgow Nikos Riverside defeated the Persian army four times already, and the Asia Minor through diplomatic means, the Greek city-states not a fight [on www.TodayOnHistory.com] smooth entry into Syria. territories with 400,000 troops in the Persian emperor Darius III at Issus City 333 BC, Darius first tasted the bitterness of this bit powerful military genius, fled to escape in the army defeated the Persian army defeat across the board, with his mother, his wife and daughter have become Alexander&#39;s captives. <br> followed Alexander to enter the Phoenician Tyre encountered stubborn resistance, finally win a victory after seven months of siege. During this period, Darius raised half of our territory to Alexander to return his Muqi peace between the two countries, Alexander refused. < br> <br> Alexander along with his friend carat Truth and a lion fighting <This is a partial picture>. <br> 332 BC, Alexander army into Egypt, the local priests and nobles war drop, and grant Alexander \"Egyptian Pharaoh\", \"the title of the son of Amun. for any ruler Alexander the era, Egypt is significant granary rest in Egypt for a period of time After that, continue eastward march. <br> 331 BC, in the the Gaugamela plains of northern Iraq, commander of the two countries met again this time, Darius III&#39;s army known as the million, and do a good job fully prepared, but before the Macedonian phalanx of Alexander still defeated Darius once again take the lead to escape after Alexander and Darius race chase and escape only by his subordinates until Darius killed Persian empire complete destruction. <br> Alexander&#39;s conquest does not end his Central Asia, in Afghanistan three years after he moved to enter western India If conquests in Central Asia or in order to eliminate the Persian Empire residual forces, then expanding into India to explore the boundaries of the world means that you already have, because this is beyond the known world then Greeks farthest boundary. to utilize the the local maharaja contradiction smooth occupied large tracts of land in northwest India, but Alexander&#39;s soldiers physically and mentally exhausted, has reached the limit, opposition to continue to move forward. Alexandria reluctant to return to the Babylonians. <br> Alexander firearms generally equipped army can defeat any army \"before this judgment, despite the many questions, but Alexander in his time has never been beaten fact. <br> Alexander greatness does not end with military achievements, the reason why his conquest proceeded smoothly, but also that he pacify the conquered areas very fruitful few stubborn resistance areas (However, he also carried out the massacre) he became the heirs of the original rulers conquered regions around the implementation of religious tolerance policy in this process, he ideological breakthrough, no longer believe that Greece was the only civilization in the world, but had a strong interest in Eastern civilization. significant recruitment Persians into his army, and also held a special large wedding. this Persian etiquette wedding, married the daughter of Alexander and Darius III, while more than 80 of his comrades-in-arms with the local noble woman married <br> Alexander conquered areas to establish many of the Greek city of immigrants over 20, has now been found, is known as the city of Alexandria, the farthest reach of Kyrgyzstan and India today, the most famous is the Egyptian port of Alexandria, the Mediterranean region in the next two thousand years has been economic and cultural center. these Greek city of immigrants became the center spread Greek culture (of course, not a simple \"Greece\" Since then hundreds of the Middle East into the Hellenistic era, but the Greek culture local culture fusion) Alexander <br> entering middle age of the world is still full of curiosity and desire to conquer he send someone visits the Arabian Peninsula, the Babylonians establish pier even conceived to communicate the Caspian Sea and the Indian Ocean. he plans to conquer the region may also include eastern India, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) Italy, Spain, Carthage, etc. but in 323 BC, a sudden falciparum malaria claimed his life, years only 33 years old. Maybe this malaria with Alexander&#39;s conquest of activities, profoundly changed the history of the world. Alexandria did not designate a successor after his death the empire carved up by several generals <br> Alexander the impact of history, the first is to make the history of the world map changes, so the vast Persian Empire on the map disappear empire he built after his death, the collapse of the rule but by several of his generals divided the Greeks still a dominant force in the conquered regions, This is still a continuation of his influence and more far-reaching impact, he led the democratic atmosphere of Greece proactive stance with Oriental despotism extensive exchanges began several hundred years in the areas he conquered \" Hellenistic era, he created dozens of Alexander City is the witness of this process. <br> Alexander and Napoleon, Genghis Khan, the great conqueror for a comparison the Napoleon conquered territory larger than he, [ history. cn] Napoleon and exit the stage of history as a loser after his territory and institutional considerable part are deliberately overthrew the territories conquered by Genghis Khan and his descendants (but rather than him The successors of Genghis Khan conquered), but the Mongols in the cultural backwardness of them in the conquest of the region can only accept the fate of being assimilated, while Alexander is based on the widely blend of advanced Greek culture to the same region was conquered. Therefore, Alexander the impact of the above two. <br> Review: Alexander the Great as a vision of the world conqueror, his father left the military heritage of the sages left the Greek cultural heritage, their own highly impact of adventure character play to the extreme, never meet something has been; him as the ruler of the world vision, land, adopt a tolerant attitude transplant Greek civilization, the Greek civilization is rooted in the Middle East soil. <br>'
