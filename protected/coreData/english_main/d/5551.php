In this case, the State of Jin, although internal discord in fear, still exclude Jinqing Shi Xie stay foreign aggression to the claims of the police internal troubles, decided without losing hegemony opportunity, Xing Shi Cheng cutting to save Song, and thus a decisive battle with the Chu revive the State of Jin dominance. <br> April of that year, Jin Li recognized for ZHENG repressor a Patriotic send troops to the Jin army to cross the river water (Yellow River), Jiling alliance with Jin pioneer Ming Yan (Henan Qixian North), threat ZHENG paranotum its not north.

To that the Chu army generals and not, ZHENG battle is not the whole barbarian soldiers not into the array, and the Ministry of Wu mixed, lax discipline each other waiting to see looking back, there is no will to fight, argue not wait for reinforcements and quick decision win. Jin Li public view of the stick to be aid will take some time, the battlefield situation is highly unpredictable, and multiply Chu of the gap quickly launch a decisive battle, although the troops not as Chu also win is abandoned Luan books of seeking from?

Chu Total Wang see the Jin Li hall in weak in the army troops, and Jin Li public car trapped in a quagmire, is the rate of the royal bodyguard jung car attack vigorous public. Luan the book Yujiu vigorous public in critical its sub-Luan? Stopped, remains whole army command and not chaos. Jin Gongzu Fuwei? Impacted in Chu left head, forcing its Back, Jin recovery offensive. Chu was informed that a total of king wounded morale shaken, and your spirit greatly reduced. Chu Youjun and Zheng soldiers in Jin heavily attack, the force can not support, quickly rout. Chu Zhongjun and left the military affected, backward retreat. Chu defeated in battle chaos, Jin army to follow up a victory across the board pursuit. ?

That night, Chu repair weapons, supplement pawns, intends to fight another day tomorrow. The Jin army more sign of weakness, it is longitudinal Chu prisoners, Jin stepped up to prepare for, winning the news the next day declared in Chu. Chu Total Wang Yu Zhao child anti deliberations should be the enemy of the policy, and the sub anti-drunk can not see the rules of procedure, since the material rematch difficult to win; Fearing aid Jin princes Army to arrive the next day, Chu disadvantage soldiers shall suffer heavy losses, if Wu multiply spacious and the onslaught of Chu, the more the danger of the boat, is by night his troops southward retreat. Jin army into the Chu camp the next day, rest for three days, thereafter spin divisions. To the end of the battle, only Qi army arrived at the battlefield. Chu retreat flaw, sub-anti-shame on dereliction of duty and suicide. Adverse strategic situation, the (lssjt.cn) <br> campaign, Chu and Jin launch a decisive battle has made a mistake, and failure to fighter attack failed to seize the favorable battlefield situation. Wei Chu Total Wang \"quit\" by night troop withdrawal, security Chu main is a wise one. The the Jin army Chu battle and topographical features, crashes decisions, timely change deployment, flexible use of force, legal system wins the typical two wings assault, reflecting the rapid development of the field of offensive tactics of the Spring and Autumn Period. Jin will battle in the repair \"officiating\" not Chu thoroughly combat, solid in the case of the Spring and Autumn Period, the limitations of the concept, not to be taken as an example. <br>'
