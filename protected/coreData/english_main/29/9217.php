'cont'=>'(On August Dingmao seventh day), September 29, 1987, the first unit of the Longyang Gorge Hydropower Station and the grid. September <br> 1987 29, the upper reaches of the Yellow River \"leading\" remarkable engineering - Longyang Gorge Hydropower Station, the first generating set at 23:10, passed the 72-hour test run, and grid . (Lsjt.org) <br> Longyang Gorge Hydropower Station is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Qinghai Province Republican County Guinan County at the junction of Longyangxia at the entrance, is 15 Cascade Hydropower Planning and Development of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. For controlling the flow of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, regulating the amount of water downstream, and plays an important role. It controls the drainage area of &#8203;&#8203;131,000 square kilometers, the annual runoff of 20.5 billion cubic meters, direct control of the upper reaches of the Yellow River nearly 65% &#8203;&#8203;of the amount of water and major flood source. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> this project started in February 1976, thousands of hydropower builders provision of mountains as water supply, after years of hard work, now one of up to 174 meters of the arch dam in the valley stands the the Green Wave vast artificial lake storing 6.1 billion cubic meters of water (storage capacity of 24.7 billion cubic meters), the main plant can accommodate four large generators of 320,000 kilowatts group basically completed complex drainage system has been formed. <br> into the huge main plant, recently installed the first of 320,000 kilowatts of generating sets being issued cheerful roar. The second unit is stepping up its installation, is expected to completed by the end. Here you want to install a total of four units, with a total installed capacity of 1.28 million kilowatts. Until the end of next year, the four generating units will be installed. <br> Longyangxia Hydropower Station years to adjust the performance and overall efficiency of the large hub project. It is mainly to generate electricity, both for flood control, irrigation, water supply and Ice Prevention role. According to reports, the hydropower annual generating capacity of 60.3 billion kWh, but also the power station with Liujiaxia compensation adjustment 640 million annual increase in generating capacity, and for the development of the Qinghai Sheng construction northwest China to provide more energy to make a downstream cascade hydropower stations. completion of the project <br> Longyangxia to control flooding in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, will fundamentally and basically removed the threat of floods and ice flood disasters, a net increase of Paul irrigation area of &#8203;&#8203;more than 1490 mu, an increase of 470 million cubic meters of urban industrial water. <br>'
