'cont'=>'September 29, 1901 (17 August 1901), the Italian scientist Fermi was born. <br> Fermi was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Fermi is doing experimental <br> Italy - American physicist fees meter is undoubtedly the greatest Italian scientists since Galileo, one of the most creative physicists in the world between 1925-1950 years. Fermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics \"found new radioactive substances and found that the choice of slow neutrons (history today. cn) <br> 1901 September 29, 2007, (lssjt.cn) Fermi was born in Rome Fermi qualification smart Agile Mind, the early years had shown promise in 1918, and thus be allowed to enter Pisa Normal school, he was later to complete their studies at the University of Pisa and received his Ph.D. in 1924 he returned to Italy after a period of time spent in G&#246;ttingen and Leiden, was appointed professor of physics at the University of Rome, no doubt due to his already published about 30 papers and established reputation, and then Italy&#39;s most distinguished physicists, Senator Ke Binuo support. <br> Fermi first published in Italy modern physics textbooks \"atomic physics Introduction \"as the beginning of his fame soon put around him attract the best young Italian physicist, but the arrogance of the Italian fascist cause the loss of the Italian scientific genius 1938, Fermi wife is Jews, forced to emigrate to the United States before leaving Italy, <br> Fermi in Rome has been an amazing yield scientist in the field of theoretical and experimental, have made an important contribution from his experimental work on trying to push Joliot - the Curie couple of achievements, Joliot - Curie couple has been pointed out in the 1934 bombardment of boron and aluminum with helium nuclei (alpha particles) will produce artificial radioactive isotopes. thought of Fermi in 1932 James - Chadwick discovered the neutron may be a better tool to create new isotopes. neutrons than alpha-particle mass is small, but the neutron is not charged, which makes it able to overcome a positive charge of the target nucleus without consuming The neutron energy <br> Fermi reported that 1934 he occasionally impulsive inserted between the neutron source and target paraffin, placed in front of the incident neutron results increased activation strength of tens to hundreds times This is the the Fermi accidental discovery of slow neutrons phenomenon. <br> slow neutrons produce later in the civilian and military nuclear energy field has a profound effect however Fermi&#39;s immediate task is to do with the slow neutron irradiation may be more than the elements of the production and study of a large number of new radioisotopes created and its nature. <br> Fermi and his colleagues in the various elements of the system irradiation process, naturally with slow neutrons bombarded uranium which necessarily cause nuclear fission (L $ dj而.c身m) Fermi transuranic elements generated is called \"ausoninum\" and \"hesperium. 1938 - Otto Frisch and Lise - Meitner First see that in this reaction, nuclear fission is occurring. <br> On the theoretical side, the main achievements of Fermi in Rome in the 汕-decay theory. this unstable nuclear process, in this process a neutron into a proton and emits an electron and an antineutrino Fermi made a detailed analysis of the introduction of a new force in science, the so-called \"weak\" force. < ; br> Fermi to the United States, keen on trying to create a controlled nuclear chain reaction in 1942, he succeeded in establishing the first atomic pile in the stadium of the University of Chicago the Stagg Square on he and his colleagues used pure graphite as a moderator to slow neutrons speed to enrich uranium as fissile material, and to begin to build the reactor. 1942 12 20, Fermi reactor into a critical state, support a self-sustaining chain style for 28 minutes, the atomic age began. the L $ dj而.妨壯T] <br> 1945 (history TodayOnHistory.com) when the test an atomic bomb explosion in the New Mexico desert, he also at the scene said that when the storm blew in front of him, he left some scraps of paper, according to the displacement of these scraps of paper, calculate the power of the atomic bomb equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT explosives (TNT). <br> After the war, a professor of physics at the University of Chicago, Fermi, until he died of cancer. physics with a variety of ways to honor him: 100 element called \"Fei; unit of length 10-13cm called Fermi; (L $ dj而.妨壯T) is called the National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, near Chicago, Fermilab (history today www.lssdjt.com) <br>'
