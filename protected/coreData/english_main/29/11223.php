(l $ dj而.身r阱) <br> Charlie four World 17-year-old, his father appointed commander-in-chief of the Bohemian army along with four campaign parade nations. Later, his father is blind, he became his father&#39;s rule by formally succeeded to the throne in 1346, he Knight career lasted not long, nor the impact of his personality, but he used to see the rivers and lakes of the sinister powers in his rookie when he had almost been political enemies poisoned. <br> but Charlie four World political means of struggle with the majority of Germany kings, not primarily rely on campaign, but by virtue of bribe money, marriage, promises and conclusion of the Covenant to achieve its own aims, in this respect, he can be said to have been the true mass grandfather Rudolph I during the reign also launched a number of war, but the scale is very small, more like clear Bandit. <br> of Germany at the time, there are more than a dozen princes, more than two hundred small princes, thousands of independent Empire Knights territory, there are numerous autonomous city. thus forming a loose confederation, the emperor was the nominal leader of this confederation, but the actual master power, but the equivalent of a large feudal lords after the long-term balance of Union War and the annexation of large princes formed the seven most prominent, they are Trier, Cologne, Mainz Archbishop of Mainz three and Rhine court of Earl, Duke of Saxony, Brandenburg border region Earl, Bohemia King four secular princes in order to establish a firm rule of the Empire, there are two possible ways: either with small princes, autonomous city, church unite against big princes, their supreme dominance, or big princes unite butcher the whole empire together. Obviously the latter approach is less risky, but also become the inevitable choice of the style of Charles IV cautious. <br> 1354, Charles IV each other down in the Northern Italian princes Many people look forward to an excellent opportunity to stabilize the situation of a powerful ruler, with army into northern Italy, the second year in Milan the iron crown of Lombardy formal coronation as emperor in Rome in November this year, grand Imperial Diet held in Nuremberg, in addition to the princes, there are a number of legal experts to participate in, the central theme is the formulation of the Constitution of the Empire of the problem there are two problems caused controversy, First Emperor of election issues, including how elections whether to allow the Pope to intervene, the princes of the city and the people within their own territory permissions problem. again Reichstag was held in in Charles IV <br> 1356 in Metz, The Charles IV issued a general meeting \"Golden Bull, the main content of the edict, the following two points: 1, clear the election of the emperor by seven Elector throne dangling by the Duke of Saxony and Rhineland palace Earl regent; 2, each elector has tariffs within their own territory and Mint rights, mining and trafficking salt rights (Prior to this, these permissions between the Emperor and Elector is not clear), prohibits an alliance against their feudal lords lord alliance against the city against the princes, offend Elector be regarded as treason. the Elector actually has a loose confederation within the framework of the despots powers within their own territory. addition, the edict avoided the role of the Pope and the Holy See in the Emperor election, in fact, deprived of the power of the Pope. <br> Charlie IV, one of the reasons is so generous Elector who want to exchange for their support for the succession to the throne to his son Wenzel (in fact, it is his own principle of election in the destruction edict), he also sent to the court of princes go to a lot of gold and silver. proved (on TodayOnHistory.com) this selfishness has become a blot of Charles IV ruling, his son, though smooth inherit his throne, but in the end the end result infirm , sparse and shallow knowledge disgraceful \"princes deposed. <br> Charles IV to give up the desire of the entire imperial power at the same time, strengthen the centralization of power in their own territory, the Kingdom of Bohemia on through redemption and other measures to expand the territory of Bohemia. tried to promote his reign is in \"the Avignon Captivity\" of Pope returned to Rome. <br> the \"gold edict of Charles IV\" established Germany as a political entity, large princes pattern, this pattern has been no qualitative change in the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 come to an end before his impact on history&#39;s largest. addition, he sponsored literary Renaissance The passion began burning in the Deutsche earth, later, the the Huss movement and Martin Luther&#39;s Protestant Reformation occurred in Germany, when there is a certain relationship with this. out of a dark two points, it was Charles IV are listed the imperial ranks of reason into the most influential, column 74 in the rankings. <br> Review: historical commentators Charles IV promulgated the the \"gold edict\" is more than that out allowed the sub to the throne of selfish fact, selfish perhaps, but more important for the recognition of objective reality, the seven princes force disaster system, Deutsche throne in each family cursory rotation, is one example. challenge big princes forces, can only give rise to endless wars, which is reluctant to rational than the ambition of Charles IV. the Charles IV wholeheartedly propagated heir Wenzel also deposed princes, both of Charles IV ironically, also make people more deeply understand the helplessness of his reign.
