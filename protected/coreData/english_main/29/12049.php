'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'December 29, 1996 (the Rat the winter on 19), the Russian tanker Nakhodka fracture pollution, coastal Japan. 29, <br> 1996 12 Russian tanker Nakhodka \"(displacement of 13,157 tons), loaded with 19,000 tons of heavy fuel oil from the Chinese Shanghai port anchor, bound for the Russian Far East port. 3 o&#39;clock in the morning on January 2, 1997, in Maizuru, Japan Coast Guard Eighth District received an emergency distress signal: the wreck of the ship in the sea about 130 kilometers northeast of the Sea of &#8203;&#8203;Japan Oki Island. After dawn, the Coast Guard helicopters flew over the crash site. I saw more than 180 m long Russian tanker from the fracture, only 50 meters away from the bow of the bow of the ship floating in the sea. Hull has been sinking into the seabed of over 2000 meters. They rescued the 31 crew members, only the captain is missing. <br> the day, patrol aircraft found leaking from the damaged tanker, a width of 3 km, about 60 km of black oil with \"floating on the sea and along the northwest wind and the Tsushima tide \"drift to the coast of Japan. It is estimated that about 4,000 tons of slick. Japanese authorities has endeavored to prevent the oil slick landing. They take a variety of measures. However, due to bad weather, almost all the way to effective immune. Treatment agent to the oil slick scattering, the purpose is the decomposition of the oil slick floating oil by marine microorganisms into harmless substances. But the Japanese Maritime days of 22 m / s wind speed, the aircraft impossible job. According to the opinions of experts, because of the oil slick than ordinary crude oil, but the high viscosity of heavy oil, therefore, even if the scattering treatment agent is also difficult to achieve the desired effect. People trying to set up the \"oil boom dike\", but the 7-meter-high waves, floating in the sea the oil boom dike seem useless. One can only stand and watch the black oil slick to drift to the coast, resulting in the most serious marine pollution incidents. tanker <br> \"Nakhodka\" is an old boat built 22 years ago. Experts estimate is due to the aging vessel hull fracture. A total of 22 oil storage compartments on the boat. The stern section sank due to the oil storage tank ruptured, heavy oil escape. However, \"Nakhodka\" bow section carrying the remaining part of the heavy oil is still drifting at sea. 7, the worst fears finally happened. The bow section with the waves drift to the coast and running aground in the sea of &#8203;&#8203;Fukui Prefecture find Square, a famous tourist attraction in Japan, the outflow of heavy oil from the damaged oil tanks, more serious pollution. 8, has six prefectures in Japan, 300 km coast was the pollution of the oil slick. And slick great drift across the Noto Peninsula trend. After the exhaustion of all methods, only the \"human wave tactics\". In order to mitigate the disaster, the 8th, pollution of coastal areas, fisheries associations organized fishermen handheld buckets, water dipper, came to the beach, manual removal of heavy oil. <br> this area is a famous resort in the Sea of &#8203;&#8203;Japan coast, one of the \"Three Views of Japan\" Amanohashidate, be regarded as the natural wonders \"Naruto Sand Beach\" legendary Maizuru Port & hellip The; ... attracts numerous visitors throughout the year. This area is also an important producer of seafood. Seaweed, shrimp, deep-water crab, abalone, conch are famous here. Stand on this coast, the smell is a pungent oily smell, see black oil lapping the shore. The few white waterfowl drilled the surface of the water it became Blackbird. Now it is here to harvest seaweed and crab season. A fisherman picked up the seaweed from the shallow water on the rocks covered with oil. This time of year, the Fisheries Association here must presented to the Emperor Sham crab, in 1997, they have said it is difficult to gift. Not only affected by seasonal seafood, and the summer harvest abalone will also be affected. The preliminary estimate of the total over a hundred billion yen, the pollution caused by the loss of fisheries and tourism income. (Lsjt.net) <br>'
