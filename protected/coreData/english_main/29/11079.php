'cont'=>'November 29, 1960 October 11 (Boxer), chlorophyll synthesis success. <br> 1960 on November 29, 2008 - German scientists Martin Manchester Demirel and American scientists, Robert Burns Woodward successful synthesis of chlorophyll. <br> a class with photosynthesis (photosynthesis) the most important pigment. Photosynthesis is the synthesis of organic compounds will light energy into chemical energy. Chlorophyll is actually found in all organisms can camp photosynthesis, green plants, prokaryotic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic algae. Chlorophyll absorbs energy from light, and then the energy is used for the carbon dioxide into carbohydrate. There are several different types of <br> chlorophyll? chlorophyll a and b are the main types found in higher plants and green algae; chlorophyll c and d are found in a variety of algae often coexist with chlorophyll a; rare chlorophyll e, see some golden algae; bacteriochlorophyll found in some bacteria. Green plants, chlorophyll found in membranous organelles called chloroplasts disc-shaped units (thylakoid). The chlorophyll molecule contains a central atom of magnesium, the peripheral is a nitrogen-containing structure, known as the porphyrin ring; connecting a very long carbon - hydrogen side chain (known as phytol chain) on the porphyrin ring. The different types of chlorophyll is caused by small changes in some of the side groups. Chlorophyll heme is very similar in structure to the pigment heme is found in mammals and other vertebrates, red blood cells to carry oxygen. -dimensional model of green plants <br> molecules is the use of carbon dioxide in the air, the sun, the soil moisture and minerals to make food for themselves, the entire process is called \"photosynthesis\", required sun were green elements to absorb within the leaves is chlorophyll, a green organic compounds. <br> chlorophyll (chlorophyll): green pigments in photosynthesis membrane, which is the main component of the capturing light for photosynthesis. [The L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] in <br> chloroplast chlorophyll (chlorophyll, chl) chlorophyll a and b two Formula: C40H70O5N4Mg, belonging to the synthesis of natural low molecular weight organic compound. Chlorophyll does not belong to the aromatic compound. They are insoluble in water, and dissolved in an organic solvent, such as ethanol, acetone, ether, chloroform and the like. Color, chlorophyll a bluish-green, yellow-green and chlorophyll b. Shown a configuration diagram of the chlorophyll, it can be seen, this molecule contains three types of double bonds, i.e. carbon-carbon double bond, carbon-oxygen double bond, and carbonitrides double bond according to the chemical nature, chlorophyll chlorophyllin of the ester, can occur to the saponification reaction. Chlorophyllin is a bis-carboxylic acid, wherein one carboxyl group esterified by methanol, another leaf alcohol esterified. <br> chlorophyll molecule contains a porphyrin ring \"head\" and a leaf phytol \"tail\". The magnesium atoms residing in the center of the porphyrin ring, biased with a positive charge, associated therewith, the nitrogen atom is biased to a negative charge, thus having a polar porphyrins, is hydrophilic, and can be combined with protein. Leaf alcohol diterpene is composed of four isoprene units, is a lipophilic aliphatic chain, which determines the chlorophyll liposoluble. Chlorophyll is not involved in the transfer of hydrogen or hydrogen oxidation reduction, only the electron transfer (electronic gains and losses caused by the oxidation-reduction) and manner of delivery (direct energy transfer) conjugated to participate in the energy transfer. porphyrin ring in <br> magnesium atom of H +, Cu2 +, Zn2 + are replaced. Leaves treated with acid, H + easy to enter the chloroplast, replacement magnesium the atom formation went magnesium chlorophyll, the leaves were brown. Go magnesium chlorophyll easy to combine with copper ions, the formation of copper on behalf of chlorophyll, the color is more stable than the original. People often treated with copper acetate According to this principle to save the green plant specimens. <br> total of a, b, c, and d4. Who carry out photosynthesis, plants release oxygen contain chlorophyll a; presence of chlorophyll b in higher plants, green algae and Euglena; chlorophyll c exists in diatoms, dinoflagellates and brown algae, and chlorophyll d present in the red algae. Chlorophyll a molecular structure consists of four pyrrole rings by four methine group (= CH-) connected to form a cyclic structure called a porphyrin (ring on the side chain). The center of the porphyrin ring in conjunction with a magnesium atom, and a cyclopentyl ketone (V), of propionic acid on the ring ¢ô the phytol (C20H39OH) esterification, after saponification to form a potassium salt with the water-soluble. In an acidic environment, the porphyrin ring of the magnesium may be H substituted referred to magnesium chlorophyll brown, its color changes to green when using copper or zinc-substituted H, such dye is stable, does not fade in the light or acid damage, the preservation of the impregnated plant specimens, is to take advantage of this feature. In photosynthesis, the vast majority of the role of chlorophyll is to absorb and transfer light energy, only a handful of chlorophyll a molecule from the conversion of light energy. They probably are in vivo and protein binding, present in the thylakoid membrane. <br> phytol the lipophilic aliphatic chain, due to its presence determines the chlorophyll molecule the lipophilic, so that it was dissolved in an organic solvent such as acetone, alcohol, ether. Mainly absorbs red and blue-violet light (a strong absorption peak at 640-660nm of the red portion and the 430-450nm blue-violet light), because the chlorophyll does not substantially absorbs green light green through substantially green, since the structure the differences in chlorophyll a bluish-green, b yellow-green. Susceptible to oxidation in the light fading. Chlorophyll is a bis-carboxylic acid ester, with an alkali saponification reaction occurs. <br> Review: photosynthesis most important pigment <br> in'
