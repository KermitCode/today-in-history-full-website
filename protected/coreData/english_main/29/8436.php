'cont'=>'August 29, 1984 (on August JiaZi third), the continental plates drift theory was confirmed. the continental plates <br> drift <br> 1984 August 29, 2010, U.S. scientists confirmed that continent on Earth is surrounded by earth slowly and continuously moving. Mirror on a special satellite of the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration with a laser shot from the early seventies, the powerful beam by a point of the Earth shines an altitude of 5600 km, the beam is then reflected back to the launch point of the Earth, according to the beam the time between two points, the distance between the two is calculated. Confirmed that such data and related research (from the rock), Europe and North America with the expansion of the Atlantic another drift away from the increasingly far closer and closer to Hawaii and South America, West, California will eventually become the Pacific Ocean an island. U.S. space observation data and plate tectonic theory is consistent, and that the continent is drifting molten rock in the mantle surface above, more than 30 km thick plate. Plate tectonic theory that the present continents formed about 300 million years ago, and drift movement began 180 million years ago. Observational data description Atlantic expansion of 1 cm per year, Hawaii and South America each year close to 5 cm separation of 1 cm per year in Australia and North America, in two different continental plates on the Northern California and Southern California in mutual squeeze annually per a plate must be worn to 6 cm. In addition, most of the earthquakes are occurring in California caused by the movement of tectonic plates. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br>'
