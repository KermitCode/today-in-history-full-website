'cont'=>'January 14, 2000 (JiMao eighth day of the twelfth lunar month), the success of human cloning monkeys. In In 2000 January 14, 2010, the BBC reported: a cloned macaque birth in the United States recently. This is the world&#39;s first successfully cloned primate --- genetically closest human animal. [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> Oregon Regional Primate Research Center research team published recently in Science magazine on their achievements in this clone. <br> only cloned monkey named Tetra, [history today www.TodayOnHistory.com] the cloning method is completely different with the birth of the first cloned sheep Dolly. Cloned monkey embryo splitting approach. The researchers repeated the experiment 13 times, 107 monkey embryos split into 368 embryos through a variety of methods, results have four mature stillborn, only Tetra Fortunately in the embryo split the 157 days after the birth. Expected in May this year, there are four pregnant females will give birth to a cloned baby. Research Center said Dr. Gerald ska Teng, these cloned monkey for human diabetes and Parkinson&#39;s disease research. Exactly the same \"because of their genes, so the response to the drug will also be the same, which will greatly simplify the experimental process. \"<br> Clone primates again aroused concerns about human cloning and speculation. The news that a private cell biotechnology company in the United States in June last year, the use of human leg cells and cow eggs successfully cloned the world&#39;s first cases of human embryos survived for 12 days. <br>'
