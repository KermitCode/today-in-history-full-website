Song Dynasty the founding emperor Kuangyin, the role of individuals also contributed to the occurrence of these changes. The (Lssdjt.com) <br> <br> Kuangyin came from the military commanders family, was born in 927 BC in Luoyang folder Maying also loved martial arts since childhood. His background and expertise in the militancy of the Five Dynasties and troubled times, climbed to his powers pinnacle of great help. 22 years old, is said by a monk&#39;s pointing, he defected to Guo Wei&#39;s army in appreciated by the of Guo Wei adopted son Chairong the. After 951 years, Guo Wei destroy Han emperor, the establishment of the Later Zhou Dynasty, three years later, Chairong the throne after King Sejong. Chairong throne soon launched the key the Gaoping of war, Kuangyin, the identity of the Old Guard of the ambulance Chairong, feats. Since then, Kuangyin attack Nantang campaigns meritorious given the rank Dianqian Douzhihuishi, become Chairong confidant of generals. 959, Kuangyin Chairong deathbed appointed point inspection Dianqian, actually mastered the military power. In the first month of <br> 960 years, Kuangyin was ordered to lead the troops to resist the invasion of the Liao, when the team travels to Chen Qiaoyi Kuangyin is said to be mutiny of soldiers crowned emperor in the case knew nothing in advance, known as & ldquo ; Chen Qiaobing change \", which began a CONSERVATORY 320 year rule. In the same year, Kuangyin quickly name revolted repression under the banner of as HouZhou revenge Jiedushi Lee Yun and Lee to re-enter it, sit tight Jiangshan. <br> sit on the throne after Kuangyin hidden face two urgent requirement to solve the problem: the end of a split situation has been since the late Tang unify the country and eliminate the generals riots coup maintain political stability. In his 16-year reign, to solve these two problems has always been the core of all of his policies. <br> Kuangyin based on the analysis of the objective situation, the adoption of the recommendations of Zhaopu first South after North order to unify the country. In 963 years, \"route through cutting Guo\" trick, in one fell swoop perish Jingnan, and Hunan separatist regime, 964 years to send generals the Wang Quanbin aliquots of both sea westward, will exterminate affluent after only 66 days Shu, 1971 off the South Han, 975 years faction generals Cao Bin, annihilated the Southern Tang pontoon bridge crossing the river. To Kuangyin died, leaving only the south Wuyue the North and the North Han linger, the country (traditional Han Chinese regions) unified actually a foregone conclusion. the <br> 961 Kuangyin famous the \"±­¾ÆÊÍ±øÈ¨\" means peace lifted Shishou Xin and other generals of the military power. But this is only the beginning of the reform of the military. Divided into three parts Kuangyin General rights, Jinjun generals only unified military power, and the right to the deployment of troops by the Privy Council to grasp, is responsible for logistics by the Division emperor center scheduling, only a master of all military power. Eliminate the hidden dangers of a military coup, Kuangyin honor to be the founding father of Chinese history, the last one to seize power through a military coup by the military reform. <br> the same time, in order to prevent local military separatism, Kuangyin world heavily, elite troops concentrated near the capital arm, and the only place to stay weak soldiers. And gradually over the governors by the generals replaced civilian faction pass sentence known to the state to the state constraints, all decrees must be signed by pass sentence and know the state to take effect. while <br> received military power, Kuangyin send transporter so that states manage finances, local fiscal revenue in addition to the necessary expenditures, the centralization of all by the transporter. In this way, the recovered property rights. <br> in the aspects of the regime, Kuangyin using surveillance and public opinion of the the \"discrete four powers\", the Central Secretariat and the Privy Council points to palm the civil and military authority, the three Division palm financial censorate and remonstrance hospital palm, respectively, directly responsible to the Emperor, weaken the powers of the prime minister (same Pingzhang, the heads of the Central Secretariat) and etiquette treatment. And shortening of office, the implementation of the posts and segregation of duties, in order to prevent the officials in a post on cultivating personal power. growth <br> Kuangyin in the Five Dynasties and troubled times, well aware of the scourge of the generals autocratic, which may contribute to the root cause of his the right text suppression Wu policy. He also set a \"do not kill the minister and letter words matter, including the oath monument to replace the generals in addition to the widely appointment literati official. The more far-reaching impact on the history of the imperial examination system reform. He banned exam Recommended system the prevailing public recommended \",\" public volume \"since the Tang and the Five Dynasties, the papers became the sole criterion for assessing admitted, greatly increase the fairness of the exam, so that there is no background the poor also have the opportunity of Chinese. He also established the retest, DianShi system, also favor the selection of a real talent. Song Dynasty culture developed, scholar of higher status, the unrelated and the initiator of Kuangyin is not. the reign during <br> Kuangyin not the Ming Li heir, but he sealed his brother Zhao Guangyi Jin Wang, Kaifeng Yin same Pingzhang own son did not give any power, Chuan Zhao Guangyi&#39;s intention is very clear. 976, Guangyi the ax light candle shadow \"Supremacy boarded throne. Zhao Guangyi is the good cause successor Kuangyin, unified except Youyun sixteen states outside the country (traditional Han Chinese areas), continue to consolidate the centralization of power, the Northern Song regime through the development of a \"bottleneck\". addition to the split situation of the end of the past century, largely unified Han areas <br> Kuangyin the greatness is that he grew up in the Five Dynasties and troubled times of the brutal and bloody, but to create a liberal political environment, is that he grew up in his military The military career Kongzong, but to create an atmosphere conducive to the literati culture flourish. But he makes the excessive concentration of power at the center, resulting in the local&#39;s weak enough to surround and protect the central; his military reform makes the soldiers do not know, will not know the soldiers, to reduce the military&#39;s combat capability, so that later in the northern minorities the war has been at a disadvantage; departments at all levels who created the Bureaucracy contain each other, and also reduces the efficiency, resulting in redundant official and redundant governance. These are his by descendants accusations. In fact, the historical figure do not have to be too demanding. Kuangyin reform the system according to the existing problems, to adapt to the situation at the time, and his successors have failed to change based on current affairs, continue to perfect to reform, leading to a poor and weak, it can not be attributed Kuangyin. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> Kuangyin in the history of China&#39;s role is not only to create a dynasty, he was a phased transition implementer. The impact of the emperors of the world rankings, he listed 58. The (lsjt.org) <br> Review: Chinese history regime usurped the kingdom are mostly short-lived, only the Song Dynasty is an exception. The inverse taken Shun Shou, but the inverse taken to Shun Shou, must be a fundamental change in the ruling ideas and administrative institutional, Kuangyin aware of this point, the focus of all his policies, it is the realization of from troubled times thinking Statecraft the transformation of thinking. Same time, he unified under the auspices of war, not only conforms to the historical trend, with the weights Song Dynasty&#39;s ruling legitimacy. [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] <br>'
