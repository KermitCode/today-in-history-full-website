'cont'=>'On the fourth day of the first month (Baba), February 14, 1869, British physicist Charles Wilson was born. <br> Charles Wilson <br> Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869 -1959 years on November 15, 2011), the British experimental physicist, winner of the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics. <br> Wilson was born on the outskirts of Edinburgh, Scotland, and graduated from Cambridge University in 1892, after staying in experimental research. In 1896, he invented a Wilson cloud chamber in a closed container, enter the pure ethanol or methanol vapor, by lowering the temperature of the steam reached saturation, the charged particle injection will produce ion path, Saturated steam the ion core condenses into small droplets, thus showing the tracks of the particles. In 1912, Wilson improved cloud chamber photographic equipment. <br> Wilson cloud chamber invention greatly promoted the development of particle physics, and a variety of charged particles are found in the cloud chamber. Because of this achievement, Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. <br> 1959, Wilson died in Scotland. <br>'
