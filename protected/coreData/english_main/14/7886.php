In addition, at the request unreasonable and unilateral move freely, and are innumerable. By this, is enough to endanger the country&#39;s independence and national survival, I dare believe this to any people of any country can not endure, until today, I dare to speak the reason for China&#39;s out of this period as much as possible of the efforts to Japan last of consciousness. Until the outbreak of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, occasioned the hope of a few micro attributed to sever.

Such action in Japan, caused Incident sufficient to meet anytime, anywhere and surplus; late night of July 7, 1999, Japanese troops actually the Marco Polo Bridge in nearby Peking purposes of illegal maneuvers, followed by the sudden attack Wanping county. My duty to defend the garrison force and for self-defense; innocent people unexpectedly into the lives and property destroyed by Japanese gunfire. Where this the fact that for the world by total see. Marco Polo Bridge incident <br> occurred after Japan&#39;s action deep enough to notice that his oral commonly resolved on the spot, and reluctance to expand the tone of the situation; its actual, the large number of troops and aircraft, tanks to cum all the new war weapon, (lsjt.org) by their respective and North Korea, and I Northeast, stream transported to the territory of Hebei. Of force aggression to the I steadily offensive around the fact that, must not they use the tone can be masked in the case. <br> Chinese government at the Marco Polo Bridge incident, Utah negotiation in good faith and Japan, Hebei Figure peaceful settlement of the events. On July 13, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had the Embassy of Japan proposed the two sides to immediately stop military action, while Japan is not set A.

And was declared: the Chinese government for the peaceful settlement of the reasons this unfortunate event, ready to accept any generally accepted by the public international law or treaties dealing with international disputes by peaceful means, such as the two sides direct negotiations, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, etc.. However, all of these, neither was Japan&#39;s home A. <br> here on the occasion, the Chinese local authorities to peacekeeping meter, which has accepted the solution proposed by the Japanese side. The Central Government also the largest of tolerance, for this solution has not been opposed to. Of the Japanese army suddenly no excuse for being in the Marco Polo Bridge, Langfang, etc., again attacked the Chinese army, and mast Medtronic book on July 26 this year, ask the Chinese military to withdraw from Peking. This is to the two sides agreed to a solution outside, to complicate the matter, and I are totally unacceptable recipient. Japanese army not wait for a reply, before the deadline before the arrival to violently into bashing the Chinese Culture Center of Peking, Chinese and foreign commercial pivot of Tianjin. Nanyuan near my garrison Japanese bombers and tanks, the siege, death is extremely strong; Tianjin aspects of people&#39;s lives or suffer killing, public buildings, cultural institutions, as well as shops residential, learned to pay a torch. Since then, enter endless, to invade southern Hebei Province and offensive Nankou, so that the scourge of war in the province.
