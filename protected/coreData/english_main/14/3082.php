'cont'=>'March 14, 1879 (February 22) JiMao Einstein&#39;s birthday. the Einstein&#39;s mothers <br> Pauline his childhood impact the great <br> Einstein was born in Germany, a Jewish family on March 14, 1879. Nazi persecution in 1933, he moved to the United States. April 18, 1955, died in Princeton. <br> 19 end of the century, the beginning of the 20th century, with the development of production and raise the level of scientific experiments, the understanding of the nature from the macroscopic world into the microscopic world, from the development of low-speed movement to high-speed movement, the natural sciences are facing major breakthrough. It was during this period, the young Einstein \"traitor\" gesture to the old scientific theories, boarded the stage of natural science. <br> Einstein boyhood had a strong interest in natural phenomena, wind and rain formation, moon hung high in the sky turned out to not fall ... these are all surprised. 1896, when the reading of the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, Einstein would like to become a physicist. Today www.TodayOnHistory.com [history] <br> but after graduation, Einstein in the state of unemployment in the Swiss city of Bern patent office only two years to find a low-level staff position. Although life is very poor, but he still persistently engaged in scientific research, read a lot of books in his spare time. During this time he laid the foundation of life science research. <br> 1905, Einstein in the special theory of relativity, the photoelectric effect and Brownian motion in three different areas achieved significant results, demonstrated a remarkable intellect. However, the scientific community respond to very few people, Langevin had the famous French scientist Albert Einstein said, only a few people around the world know what is relativistic. Most people are skeptical, some even resolutely opposed. This is because the theoretical system of Galileo and Newton founded classical mechanics, experienced 200 years of development has made brilliant achievements. Despite the old theory system and the fact that the sharp contradictions between, but many physicists still can not get rid of its shackles. They try to turn the new experimental facts and physical phenomena accommodated in the old theoretical framework, but Einstein is not superstitious predecessors, he explores the theory of relativity to promote broader movement. To this end, he studied for a full 10 years. In 1916, Einstein published a summary of general relativity principle. <br> famous by the creation of the theory of relativity, Einstein. The establishment of the principle of relativity is a leap in the process of human understanding of the natural world. Relativistic satisfactorily traditional physics including among its own theoretical system. General relativity broaden the horizons of human scientific research range from the infinitely large to the infinitely small microscopic world until the macro world. Today, the theory of relativity has become the theoretical basis of the Atomic Energy Science, Astronautical and astronomy, has been widely used in theoretical and applied sciences. Einstein&#39;s great achievements - the theory of relativity, is an epoch-making milestone in the history of the development of natural science. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> Einstein is not only a great scientist, or a sense of justice, a social activist. His concern for human civilization and progress. When the Second World War, he publicly condemned the atrocities committed by Germany and France, and therefore become the object of the German Nazis hunt. [Lssjt.cn] Einstein also condemned Japan&#39;s imperialist aggression against China. In his later years, he advocated disable nuclear weapons, against the nuclear arms race. Before death, he is still obsessed with civil liberties and world peace. <br> 1955 18, science giant Einstein died. Than his lifetime will, his ashes scattered in unknown place, do not send the obituary, do not build the tomb, and can not stand the monument. Cremation exempt from all public gatherings, free from all religious ceremonies, and waive all floral and all music ceremony. According to his will, the people present when the cremation only: the eldest son, Hans Albert Einstein, executors, economists Natan, Einstein, the most loyal collaborators Ducasse, assistant Illinois Stein , Books the administrator Fantuo baby, and his wife 12. Do not play music, no flowers, the silence in the chapel. Only when the end of the ceremony, the executor Natan, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) read Goethe memorial Schiller&#39;s poetry, to express their grief: <br> we all benefit from the world <br> Thanks to his teachings; <br> dedicated his personal things, <br> already spread to the general population. <br> him like a comet about to perish, Guanghua radiance, <br> unlimited light for ever with his light combination. <br> Einstein and Mileva were married in 1930, (TodayinHistory.cn) but marriage is not harmony <br> 1914, Mileva, and two sons, Edward and in 1921 Hans Albert <br>, <br>, Einstein and his second wife, Eliza, this time they did find of a happy <br> Einstein like the violin, Einstein the high attainments <br> As Jews in World War II went into exile in the United States, together with the American physicist Oppenheimer <br> love Stan life created the many theories <br> Einstein and rumored Soviet spy Women&#39;s Division years Bokova fell in love <br> Einstein and his first wife Mileva <br> Einstein elected man of the 20th century up to its name <br> Einstein and his wife, the children together <br>'
