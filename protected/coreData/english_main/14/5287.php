'cont'=>'June 14, 1993 (April 25) πÔ”œ Shenfu Dongsheng coalfield construction in full swing. <br> 1993, China&#39;s current proven the largest coalfield - Shenfu Dongsheng coalfield development and construction is in full swing. This coalfield have the annual production capacity of 10 million tons of coal, an annual output of 30 million tons of coal the size of the key works have already started preliminary work of an annual output of 60 million tons of coal scale works ready. <br> Shendong coalfield located in southern Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, the proven reserves of 23 billion tons, accounting for 1/4 of the country has proven reserves, is one of the world&#39;s eight major coalfields. Coal quality, the superior mining conditions, the central leadership has repeatedly clear requirements, before and after 2000 this coalfield built of large energy reserve base, strategic approach to achieve our energy westward movement. East coalfield building <br> God, take a completely different approach, that in accordance with the scale of the market economy, the development of mines, roads, electricity, Hong Kong, avionics integration, production, supply system, by Huaneng Fine Coal Company unified planning and organization building, unified production and management.
