'cont'=>'March 14, 1995 (February 14), seeing in the man&#39;s first dinosaur genetic material obtained from a dinosaur egg fossils. <br> 1995 3 14, a group of young scientists in the School of Life Sciences, Peking University recently successfully obtained from the two special dinosaur egg fossils dinosaur gene fragment. This is the first human dinosaur genetic material obtained from a dinosaur egg fossils. Dinosaur egg fossils, actually there bioactive substances of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, has long been extinct, scientists pleasantly surprised. This discovery, dinosaurs and living environment, the origin of species and biological evolution of human understanding, is of great significance. Xixia County, Henan Late Cretaceous C-type dinosaur egg fossils <br> While it has the internal cavity, the cavity floc was brown. Zhang Yun, a professor of the School of Life Sciences, Peking University, from which to remove a small amount of floc, was found to contain amino acids and other organic matter. <br> Professor Chen Zhangliang its laboratory use of a group of young scholars in recent years to establish a set of molecular biology techniques and laboratory equipment, using isotope labeling and PCR amplification techniques further confirms While this dinosaur egg fossils that The presence of DNA, and successfully amplified by a series of specific DNA fragments. By DNA sequencing, gene database through the computer with the United States and the European Community, get more than one gene fragment homologous gene fragments with protein synthesis necessary 18SrDNA of amphibians, reptiles, birds , mammals and human 18SrDNA homology of 73-81%, no homology with prokaryotes. This indicates that the gene fragment is neither a human operation of pollution, nor is it due to bacterial contamination. The addition get (Lssdjt.com) <br> cadherin genes. Animal growth hormone receptor precursor protein gene, thyroid hormone receptor gene, zinc finger protein gene, as well as the original chicken histone gene equivalent borne higher fragment, these results were obtained after repeated experiments. These findings open up a new field of study of ancient molecular biology. Has written some research papers published in the recently published \"Peking University\". <br>'
