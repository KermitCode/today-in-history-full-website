'cont'=>'On (Tiger years leap May 21), July 14, 1998, El Nino ravaged the world. raging global <br> El Nino \"target =\" _blank \"> El Nino phenomenon consequences <br> 1998, the global climate is generally abnormal, its important because people often say\" El Nino & rdquo ; phenomenon at play. (history www.lssdjt.com) then the El Nino phenomenon in turn, how come? <br> El Nino phenomenon known as El Nino events, according to the provisions of the World Customs Organization (WOO), the eastern equatorial Pacific abnormal elevation of seawater temperature phenomenon known as El Nino El Nino is Spanish, it is the intent of the \"El Nino\" back in the early 18th century, Peru and Ecuador, the fishermen are found every few years twips fish production dropped once, and the sharp drop in the time showed a strong regularity, almost all concentrated in the \"Christmas\" (Dec. 25) before and after (history TodayOnHistory.com) local the phenomenon known as \"El Nino\", as an expression of their piety of Jesus Christ, in fact, this is and now they say the El Nino phenomenon. <br> fishing a substantial reduction in Pacific sea water temperature flows to South Americas coastal reflux, sudden rise in the sea water temperature. schools of fish can not stand this heat flow, or loss of life in the ocean, or displaced to a foreign country, far from humans first noted that the El Nino phenomenon, has experienced more than two centuries Now, scientists have realized that this phenomenon is by no means only affect fishermen in Peru and Ecuador, but originated in the tropical Pacific and then proceeded to spread one-third or even half of a large area of &#8203;&#8203;the Earth&#39;s climate anomalies. <br> ; generation of the El Nino phenomenon is the result of the interaction of atmospheric circulation and ocean circulation, only a quarter of the total area of &#8203;&#8203;the land area of &#8203;&#8203;the Earth&#39;s surface, and the water area accounts for three-quarters to four oceans on Earth largest Pacific, for example, its area of &#8203;&#8203;179.86 million square kilometers (accounting for 35% of the Earth&#39;s total area of &#8203;&#8203;511 million square kilometers). spoke of the sea people naturally think of \"no wind, three feet waves\" This sentence means that seawater example of never-ending motion of the fluid in constant motion, tidal movement, tsunami outbreaks are seawater; from a macro on ocean circulation is one of the main forms of exercise. to the Pacific, for example, the main north-south two major circulation. northern circulation clockwise by the North Equatorial Stream, Taiwan Warm North Ocean warm and California cold snap. the southern circulation is counterclockwise, it warm current from the south to the equator, the East Australian warm westerly drift and Peru cold snap. (on com) <br> In addition, the Earth&#39;s surface package has a thick layer of gas, this is what people call the atmosphere. atmosphere in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the Earth can be divided into the troposphere, the stratosphere, the middle layer thermosphere and exosphere major weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, the atmosphere is constantly moving fluid, so on earth, ups and downs, lightning and thunder this spectacular spectacular. atmospheric circulation can also be formed , circulating in a larger scale. direct contact with the atmosphere and the sea surface, these two circulation (atmospheric circulation and ocean circulation) occurs interactions. 1957-1958,1972-1973,1976,1982-1983 rare 4 times strong El Nino 1982 to strong El Nino years occurred in 1983, not only long duration, and a wide range of spread. According to incomplete statistics, the 1982 year alone more than 1,000 people died in this kinds of natural disasters, economic losses of over 80 billion U.S. dollars, Australia lost a total of more than 30 billion U.S. dollars, the amount of fishing the Kingdom of Peru&#39;s fishing dropped significantly, even away from the Pacific, Europe and Africa have also been varying degrees of impact. <br> China&#39;s vast territory, across the tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal four temperature zones, and is located in the Pacific West Bank, El Ni&#241;o also inevitably affect our climate. figures show that abound in China&#39;s Yellow Sea and Bohai prawn production is closely related to the El Nino phenomenon. Whenever the El Nino phenomenon occurs, shrimp production decreased 30%, the average rate of decline for the occurrence of strong El Ni&#241;o phenomena, the decline in production is even more significant, the average decline a rate of as much as 70%. strongest El Nino in 1982, shrimp production only high yield of the Year (1956 and 1979), 1/7. <br> In addition, in 1982, China Southern drought North waterlogging phenomenon, grain cut tens of billion kilograms, which is caused by the El Nino phenomenon, our scientists also found that: When El Nino occurs after the following year the Hunan flood season precipitation above normal, and their statistical significance level El Nino occurred in more than 99%; phenomenon summer (6-8 months), most of the northeast region of temperature low (there are exceptions), and the following year than average summer temperatures slightly below shows that our climate is also within the scope of the phenomenon El Nino . <br>'
