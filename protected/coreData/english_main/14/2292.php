'cont'=>'March 14, 1983 (30 Guihai the first month), OPEC members agreed to cut the price of oil for the first time. 14, March <br> 1983 to restore control of the world oil market, a member of the oil-exporting countries in the establishment of the organization agreed to cut the price of oil for the first time in 25 years. 13 oil-exporting countries gathered in London also stipulates that no more than 1750 barrels daily production of oil, less than the current daily maximum limit of 100 million barrels, but still at least 350 million barrels higher than the actual production. Since 1974, the price of oil rose from less than $ 5 a barrel to $ 35. Saudi Arabian light crude oil prices as a reference point, the new agreement is reduced to $ 29 per barrel, a 15% reduction.
