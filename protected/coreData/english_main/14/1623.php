'cont'=>'February 14, 1946 (13 BingXu the first month), the world&#39;s first computer was born. work in the <br> In 1946 February 14, 2010, the ENIAC, the world&#39;s first computer ENIAC was born in the United States, University of Pennsylvania. (History www.lssdjt.com) <br> during World War II, the United States military requirements of the University of Pennsylvania Mocci to (Mauchly), Ph.D., and his students Aike Te (Eckert) designed to vacuum tubes replaced relays &#39;s \"electronic\" computer - the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and the Calculator), the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) purpose is to be used to calculate ballistic. This machine used 18,800 vacuum tubes, 50 feet long, 30 feet wide, covering an area of &#8203;&#8203;1500 square feet, weigh up to 30 tons (about a half classrooms the six elephants Weight). Its calculation speed, can be engaged in the addition of 5000 times per second, in operation for nine years. Electricity guzzlers, rumored ENIAC every time I boot, the entire the Philadelphia West End lights are whom eclipsed. <br> In addition, the vacuum tube attrition rate is quite high, almost every 15 minutes may burn a vacuum tube, the operator has to spend more than 15 minutes to find a broken pipe, very inconvenient to use. It has been quipped: \"As long as that machine can continuous operation for five days without a vacuum tube burned, invention necessary overjoyed.
