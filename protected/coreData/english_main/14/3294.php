'cont'=>'April 14, 2007 (Chinese New Year on February 27), \"Long March III A carrier rocket of a Beidou navigation satellite into space. In In 2007, April 14, at 4 pm 11, China at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the \"Long March III A carrier rocket, the success will be a Beidou navigation satellite into space. <br> about 14 minutes later, the satellite separated from the rocket. The data from the Xi&#39;an Satellite Monitoring Center showed that the satellite entered orbit accurately. The relevant departments of the person in charge, the Beidou navigation satellite (COMPASS-M1), this launch is a construction plan of the Chinese Beidou Navigation System (COMPASS) satellites, flying at a height of 21,500 km in a circular orbit. The satellite was successfully launched, marking the Beidou satellite navigation system developed by China into the new development and construction phase. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) <br> satellite navigation system for human bring enormous social and economic benefits, only a few countries in the world capable of independent research and production of satellite navigation system. China had the February 3, 2007 at the Xichang launch a Beidou navigation test satellites, satellite accurate orbit satellite and ground test work smoothly. <br> series Beidou navigation satellite launched by China in the next few years, plans around 2008 to meet the needs of users of satellite navigation systems in China and the surrounding areas, and networking and test the system, and gradually expanded into a global satellite navigation system . This system will be mainly used for the national economic construction, traffic transportation, meteorology, petroleum, marine, forest, communications, public security departments, and other special industry provides efficient navigation and positioning services. <br> The launch of the satellite and the China Academy of Space Technology and China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology developed for the launch of the \"Long March III A carrier rocket from the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation belongs. This is the 97th flight of the Long March series of carrier rockets. <br>'
