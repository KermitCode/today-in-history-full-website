Faced with this situation, the strength of the Chinese Navy is a bit stretched our vast frontier of Haiphong, but only small and medium-sized ships and short-range shore-based aviation, once the war at sea, sometimes only feel powerless and frustrated. development of an aircraft carrier, you can be a good way to solve these problems. <br>, but unfortunately, then the country&#39;s economic strength is not the beginning of 1984, I speak in the first session of the meeting of naval equipment technology too: Navy to build aircraft carriers is not a short time, and now national strength can not, it seems to wait for a period of time, and two years later, I again mentioned: the aircraft carrier is always made, always consider the aircraft carrier by 2000. 1986 In November, I chaired the Naval Development Strategy Seminar, invited military and non-military leaders and renowned experts. many comrades from safeguard China&#39;s maritime rights and interests, and to regain the strategic task of the Nansha Taiwan regression demand, it is recommended that the development of the Navy aircraft carrier and I own thinking. <br> in 1987, held a work conference of naval equipment and technology, I mentioned aircraft carriers should be made to adapt to the needs of future wars, to be a good research and demonstration. now, countries pay attention to the development of the aircraft carrier in either offensive or the vertical short distance between them, are in order to solve the problem of air defense and sea attack, in attention to the development Therefore, I request as early demonstration, to get this problem thoroughly studied. <br> ; we engage in an aircraft carrier, not for the purpose of the game and the United States, the Soviet Union, is mainly used to solve the Struggle with Taiwan in the need to resolve the Spratly Islands dispute and maintenance as well as the interests of the tasks usually can also be used to expand the political influence of the maintenance of world peace Obviously, the Navy have an aircraft carrier, the quality of the Navy&#39;s major changes occur, the Navy&#39;s combat capability will also be greatly improved, will help improve the military might, Guowei 31, <br> in 1987 to the headquarters authorities, reported about naval equipment planning two major problems: First, the aircraft carrier The first nuclear submarine. these two issues related to the construction of the naval force at the core, is a key problem. the long run, it is advantageous to the national defense construction: This debut equipment not only to wartime, usually deterrent force. <br> We envision the development of the aircraft carrier, \"Seventh argument, the\" Eighth Five-Year Plan \"to engage in research on the platform and the key topics of the aircraft pre-research, as the case in 2000 on the model. <br>'
