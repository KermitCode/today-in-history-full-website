The experiment also proved regardless of how long the current wires may twinkling through. Soon science will produce electricity miracle of creation. \" American Samuel Morse <br> here keep in mind live. Lenovo him what he saw from the French signal system, every time it could only vision clinics and Communications miles; if the current transmission of electromagnetic signals, it is not possible in the moment messaging thousands of miles away? <br> Since then, Morse life has undergone a fundamental change.

He lives frugally, for the purchase of Experimental equipment. In 1836, he had to re-artist-speaking old industry to solve the problem of livelihood. But he never interrupt the research work. <br> unremitting efforts and the help of friends, Morse finally been successful. His use of alternating current energized and cut the signal, and the preparation of the codes represent letters and numbers, known as the Morse code. From 1837 to 1838, he made the telegraph a short distance from the transmitted signals. <br> long-distance test requires a lot of funds. Apply to Congress, the allocation of $ 30,000, and the construction of a telegraph line connecting Washington and Baltimore. Until two years later, in March 1844, Congress passed only appropriation.
