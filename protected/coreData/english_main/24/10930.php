I feel Jiaozuo &#39;60 Minutes&#39; bold initiative! Controversial Do not be afraid, because the news the spirit of the most important one is to trigger public debate, and thinking about the problems we encountered! \"In 11 of 22 May\" 60 Minutes \"program as invested in the United States an\" atomic bomb \". The repercussions caused by the program even beyond the the CBS original estimate.
