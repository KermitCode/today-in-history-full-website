'cont'=>'February 24, 1804 (, month 14 JiaZi), Russian physicists, geophysicists, Lenz was born. February 24, 1804 <br> Lenz was born in Estonia. The 16-year-old was admitted to the home Road Pat University. 1828 to be selected as the primary scientific assistant of the Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia, was elected a Corresponding Member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1830, elected in 1834 Academician. Had long served as the Head of the Department of St. Petersburg University, Physics, Mathematics, and later by the professor will be selected as the first president. <br> Lenz major achievements in physics is to discover Lenz&#39;s law of electromagnetic induction and electric effect Joule - Lenz&#39;s law. <br> 1833, in St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences Lenz read out his entitled \"electricity dynamics method to determine the direction of the induced current papers presented Lenz&#39;s law. Helmholtz prove Lenz&#39;s law is the law of conservation of energy of the electromagnetic phenomena. <br> 1831, Lenz induced current transient and shock-like effect, the impact method quantitative study of electromagnetic phenomena, determine the induced electromotive force in the coil is equal to the electromotive force and in each turn, with wires independent of the thickness and type. In 1838, Lenz also studied the conversion of electric motors and generators, Lenz&#39;s law explains the conversion principle. In 1844, Lenz in studying any electromotive force and resistance of the parallel, drawn the shunt current law, four years earlier than Kirchhoff more general law of the circuit. (Lssjt.cn) <br> 1865 winter, Lenz died in Rome, Italy stroke. <br>'
