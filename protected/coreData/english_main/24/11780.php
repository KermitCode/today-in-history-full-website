'cont'=>'December 24, 1987 (Dingmao winter in early four), the Chengdu-Chongqing railway electrification project is completed. <br> 1987 12 24, the Chengdu-Chongqing railway electrification project after years of painstaking construction was finally built across the board, and confirmed by the state today. After the Chengdu-Chongqing railway electrification, the annual transport capacity increased by 6.1 million tons to 13 million tons, equal to the new repair a Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. <br> Chengdu-Chongqing Railway west from Chengdu, east of Chongqing, a total length of 505 km, was opened to traffic on July 1, 1952, it is the first railroad built after the founding of New China. Low construction standards, the transport capacity can not meet the traffic needs of the development, the opening of more than 20 years after several technological transformation, the annual transport capacity from the initial 300 million tons to 610 million tons. 1970s, a full range of transport capacity is saturated, forcing a large number of producers to transport quotas \"has become the highlight weaknesses in constraining economic development in Sichuan. To resolve difficulties in passenger and freight transport, to promote southwest of economic construction, in March 1980, the Chengdu-Chongqing railway electrification main project officially started in 1984, the State Planning Commission as a national key project and has segment opened to traffic. The (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> railway electrification, roadbed, bridges and various technical conditions have been greatly improved. Locomotive traction speed, not only can greatly improve labor productivity and the smooth transportation of passengers, comfortable and clean, and can save a lot of energy, and does not pollute the environment, greatly increase the transport capacity to ease the transportation tension. According to the determination of the electrified railway line opened to traffic, the average unit cost of 1.01 yuan lower, to reduce annual transportation spending nearly 70 million energy saving 46,000 tons translation of standard coal, equivalent to saving 4.14 million yuan of funds, transportation security has been a reliable protection. <br>'
