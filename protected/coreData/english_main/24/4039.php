'cont'=>'(Gengxu March 19), April 24, 1970, China&#39;s first man-made earth satellite into space. <br> China launched the first artificial Earth satellite <br> 1970 April 24, 2011, our own design, manufacturing the first artificial Earth satellite \"Dongfanghong\" by \"Long March 1\" carrier rocket first launch. Satellite orbit nearest point 439 kilometers from Earth, the farthest point of 2384 km, the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of Earth&#39;s equator 68.5 degrees around the earth 114 minutes a week. The satellite, weighing 173 kg, 20009 megacycles of frequency broadcast \"The East is Red\" song. The call of Chairman Mao Zedong, \"we also engage in a satellite\". It is a scientific star in China, the Chinese working class, the People&#39;s Liberation Army, intellectuals jointly made an outstanding contribution to the motherland. During the third National People&#39;s Congress convened in 1964, when actively advocate Zhao nine chapters, renowned scientists in our country wants to satellites, wrote to Premier Zhou Enlai, the proposal as soon as possible to carry out satellite research. (History. Cn) quickly Nie, Zhang Aiping, (lssjt.cn) Zhang Jinfu leaders and Kezhen, Qian Xuesen scientists support this proposal. <br> In order to carry out the work on the development of China&#39;s first satellite, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in September 1965, began to build a satellite and Design Institute. Scientist Qian Ji, under the leadership of the overall program of scientific and technical personnel of China&#39;s first artificial satellite launched feasibility studies, to determine the satellite indicators than the first satellite countries in ensuring the reliability based on first launch further, that a continuous signals. Music and dance epic \"The East is Red\" enormous impact and give people left a deep memory, the scientists decided to simulate electron oscillations \"The East is Red\" song. This is a Chinese characteristics, technically advanced identification signal. In May 1966, the National Defense Commission of Science, Technology and Industry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the person in charge of the Seventh Ministry of Machine mutually agreed, will be China&#39;s first artificial satellite named \"Dongfanghong. Formally identified in early 1967, China&#39;s first artificial satellite to broadcast the Dongfanghong music, let people around the world can hear the voice of the Chinese satellite. In December, the official naming of the first artificial satellite \"Dongfanghong. The overall objective summarized four sentences: have to go, captivated, see and hear. The the <br> \"Dongfanghong experienced its appearance, initial sample and prototype development phase of scientific and technical personnel who work hard, work together to overcome difficulties one after another. April 1, 1970, two \"Dongfanghong\" satellite, a \"Long March 1 launch vehicle arrived in northwest China&#39;s Jiuquan launch site. 10 points, on April 24, 1970 Level 1, 2 and 3 carrier rocket is working, the satellite separated from the rocket normally satellite accurately orbit. Pleased to say that Premier Zhou get this message: \"ready to celebrate! And announced the next day at a meeting of the three countries was held in our country: \"To celebrate the success of this meeting, I brought you a present of the Chinese people, this is yesterday, China successfully launched its first artificial satellites ...... \"<br> Since the first artificial satellite into space, China&#39;s space technology has entered a new era. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the Central Military Commission of the satellite career is booming. Remote sensing satellite launch several recycling success; geostationary communication satellite launch the sentinel successful; polar orbit meteorological satellite was successfully launched. The fruits of victory in this series, marking China&#39;s satellite technology in many important areas reached the world level, we are out of the one suited to China&#39;s national conditions, the development of the satellite cause road with Chinese characteristics. photo <br> \"Cultural Revolution\": when the satellite by Beijing over competing overlooking. <br>'
