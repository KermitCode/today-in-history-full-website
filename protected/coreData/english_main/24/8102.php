'cont'=>'(Tiger July third), August 24, 1998, Professor Eiichi chip implanted in his arm to be successful. implanted arm <br> the electronic chip <br> of 1998 on August 24, 2010, the British professor of cybernetics at Reading University of Warwick will the chip implanted own arm to succeed, and thus become the world&#39;s first body carrying chip. <br> Warwick surgery under local anesthesia chip implanted in the arm. Chip and placed in 23 mm long, 3 mm in diameter, a small glass tube, the tube in addition to the silicon chip, as well as the electromagnetic coil. <br> duration of this trial is expected for a week or so. Within this time, Warwick will use a body carrying the chip, a variety of automatic control test in his office. The chip contains 64 instructions, these instructions can be issued by a special signal. Sensor receives the instruction after the introduction of a host computer. The computer will be based on the instructions door or light switch, adjust the temperature in the office operation. It is believed that, in the human implantable chip technology is expected to be used to enable persons with disabilities to take better care of their own life. <br> Some experts believe that although Warwick antibiotics used in the test, but there are still arm inside a small glass tube leak or the possibility of fragmentation caused by infection, his trial risked no small risk.
