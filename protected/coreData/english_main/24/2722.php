Religious reform so that London is full of murderous, Anne Boleyn, she was three years old his mother killed his father Henry VIII, she can also be reduced to nothing \"illegitimate daughter\". <br> <br> Henry VIII was the first wife in order to achieve devout Catholics from Spain to divorce Catherine, so the purpose of marriage with Anne Boleyn, at the falling out with the Vatican, in the Britain set off a vigorous Protestant movement. But this occasional incentives achievements inevitable result, Protestants get the support of the majority of British nationals, and from the later history of this religious reform is in line with the trend of development in the UK. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> 1553, Elizabeth&#39;s half-sister Mary I to the throne, with his mother, Catherine, Mary, is a devout Catholic, and she sank into the experience of illegitimate daughter and was placed under house arrest Protestantism is closely related to the implementation of the process, which makes her Protestant hated reigned five years, more than 300 radical Protestant onto the stake, and thus is known as \"Bloody Mary\". In addition, she is the marriage of King Philip II of Spain, Britain was involved in the war with France, the results of the loss of the last territory on the European continent - Port of Calais, also makes people deeply dissatisfied. During this period, the British domestic rattling like Law, German as doom occurrence of large-scale religious war, it is possible to land to the British head. <br> adversity can hone the human heart and mind, Elizabeth&#39;s childhood by a good education, so she seems precocious.

At the same time, however, the domestic sheep eat the \"enclosure movement\" to continue to develop, leading to growing stray population. Government ban on enclosure grasp very loose, \"bloody legislation against Rangers caught very strict, and every year four hundred homeless people brought to the gallows. Although this process is an important step in the development of British capitalism, but is obviously extremely inhumane. the <br> Elizabeth watched Spain&#39;s maritime dominance, such as the day, she is not far behind, determined to have a share, but the early British sea power is still difficult to compete with Spain (on TodayOnHistory.com) Elizabeth took advantage of pirate Hawkins adventures of Drake et al. from Spanish hands Hukouduoshi, rising star Drake completed in 1577 a three-year Global a week on piracy, a huge harvest, Queen&#39;s awards, called piracy classic. To the the Elizabeth era of the late, along with the growth of the naval forces began the war with Spain the positive. From their infamous slave trade, Elizabethan wiped away a stain. Elizabethan life, <br> remains the focus of virginity is her compelling. She faced many suitors from the French, German, Spanish, Swiss and other King room has been cleverly deal, finally announced, \"I have been married to England the whole country,\" declared suitor annihilated. The unusual relationship between her minions Dudley Lord aroused people&#39;s interest, but also the only flowering, not results. Maybe she did not get married is wise, whether with foreign Catholic royal marriage, or fell into a complex power struggle with domestic Protestant nobles married would make her and her country. <br> but not married to bring a heir problem, Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, the nearest relatives, because she offended the domestic nobility forced to Refugees of England, in fact, under house arrest by Elizabeth because Mary ﹞ Stuart is a Catholic, she was involved in England&#39;s conservative Catholic forces into a series of coup attempt to overthrow Elizabeth, the final in 1586, Elizabeth \"reluctant\" to sentenced to beheading. (Lsjt.net) Elizabeth died or let the son of Mary Stuart, to any Scottish King James inherited the English throne. Chose James, rather than the other competitors of the succession to the throne, which perhaps reflects the vision of Elizabeth. James&#39; throne, England and Scotland into one end of the British Isles from the territorial ambitions of cannibalism and mutual threats, Briton from to concentrate on overseas expansion. <br> 1570, Elizabeth was the Vatican excommunicated her religious policy gradually became severely sacrificed Catholic Mary Stuart is a sign of repression of the Catholic Irish, also unusually hard. The Irish War nine years, to deepen the cracks between the two countries, paving the way for posterity thorny Ireland. <br> Elizabeth encouraged piracy against the Spaniards, as well as from trade and religious considerations involved in the Dutch war of independence against the Spaniards, greatly angered the Spanish King Philip II, he began to use against Mary Stuart Elizabeth in Mary Stuart was executed after finally sit, determination lessons uppity Elizabeth.

After two navies played against each other the outcome, but the old remote state of England to Spain to compete with the seas, which is already a big step forward. The Elizabeth of history (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> can be understood from the following aspects. First, her recovery of Protestant and conservative strategy to make England through the \"bottleneck\" of the Reformation, avoid like the law, as a large-scale outbreak of religious war in Germany, and even lead to the disintegration of the country&#39;s fate. Secondly, during the reign of wool production and trade progress has been made, which is the basis for the later development of capitalism, marine adventure activities increase, the rapid growth of naval forces, two points for Britain developed into the world&#39;s number one capitalist power and supremacy at sea ready good condition.

Looking at her policies, to restore Protestant position, encourage maritime trade and exploration strengthen naval forces through the succession to the throne of Great Britain unified enclosure tolerance, a non-compliant historical trend wise. Most periods in history, countries need to just be able to follow the historical trend of the monarch. <br>'
