'cont'=>'May 24, 1822 (, Imo April fourth day), the French astronomer Encke forecast a comet&#39;s perihelion date. <br> Encke comet (2P/Encke) is weaker brightness, most frequently a comet. First discovered it in the January 17, 1786, until November 26, 1818, found that after 6 weeks of the time used by the French astronomer Encke, calculated the orbit of the comet, and a period of 3.3 years, and Prophecy back to May 24, 1822 perihelion, and sure enough it get back in time, become the second prophecy regression of comet particles, known as \"Comet Encke. <br> Encke comet is not only the brightest of considerable magnitude, most of the time without a tail, just a mass of vague cloud floc. From the return of 57 times to the present, the diligence of a \"back home\" most. The orbit of the comet is getting smaller and smaller, each regression, the cycle should be shortened three hours, by some estimates, one day it will fall into the sun or self-fragmentation. The shortest cycle <br> comet, is the second teeth comet prophecy regression. 1818 by JL Pons, France the (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) Germany JF Encke first calculated its orbit, the forecast for the next regression is named. Recently distance and aphelion were 0.3380 and 4.0937 astronomical units away from the cycle eccentricity 3.2984 0.8474. Encke comet is a small comet discovered in 1818 when the brightness is only 5, not with the naked eye exercises had been generally no longer have a tail, just a telescope is not too bright cloudy small spots. Encke comet significant acceleration phenomenon, almost every time it returns will be 0.10 to 0.13 days in advance, so it was predicted that the end of the 20th century it will fall into the sun, but some people think its true brightness from 1902 to 1990 did not change significantly accelerated phenomenon also ease, may also exist for some time. <br>'
