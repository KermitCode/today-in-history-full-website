'cont'=>'February 24, 1995 (25) seeing in the first month, the central government called for the strengthening of the emphasis on the \"three rural\" issues. <br> Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Hu Jintao attended the Central Rural Work Conference <br> 1995, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, stressed that the development of the socialist market economy under the new situation in the Central Rural Work Conference must correctly handle the problems of agriculture, rural areas and farmers, and the whole party than it has ever been more attention to agriculture and rural work. <br> Jiang said, from October 1993 to the present, less than two years, the Central Committee convened three conference on rural work. Each meeting, stressed the important role of agriculture and rural work. Central Why repeatedly emphasized this problem? Mainly because the development of the socialist market economy is a new topic in the development of the socialist market economy, how agriculture upswing is a new task requires all party comrades to seriously study and exploration. From years of practice, thinking and understanding and co-ordinate the arrangements to solve is not good enough, is not big enough for agricultural protection and support efforts, did not fully implement the policies and measures have been identified, the gap between industrial and agricultural development speed The urban-rural income gap, the difference between the developed regions and the economic development of underdeveloped areas are still widening. The three gaps continue to expand it, will result in serious consequences. First, the contradiction between supply and demand of agricultural products will be more prominent, affecting the prices continue to rise, increasing inflationary pressures. The second is the slow growth of farmers&#39; income, it is difficult to schedule to achieve the goals of the farmers living a comfortable living standard. This will not only affect the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, will also affect the entire process of socialist modernization. If not to mention high purchasing power of farmers, the rural consumer market not growing or even shrink, it will directly restricts the development of the industry and the economy as a whole. Between urban and rural, regional economic development gap is too large, will lead to the disparity between the rich and the poor, leading to a serious imbalance of the whole economy and society. <br> Jiang Zemin said, the above description, in the historical conditions of the establishment of a socialist market system, strengthen macro-control, to vigorously protect and support agriculture, and promote the coordinated development of industry and agriculture, urban and rural, east and Midwest economy, relationships China&#39;s reform, development and stability in the success or failure of global relations throughout the modern career, relationships, the consolidation of the socialist regime. This major issue, the Party members, especially high-ranking cadres of the party, be sure to proceed from the overall height to further unify their understanding, unity of will, unity of action, really, rather than oral strengthen the agricultural foundation, to mobilize all walks of life force take firm and effective measures to promote the development of agriculture, farmers rich and social progress in rural areas, to achieve the goal. <br> main harvest of the meeting there are four: First, a unity of thinking. To effectively curb inflation, to maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national economy, must be determined to boost agriculture. Two clear tasks. The focus is to grasp the \"rice bag\", \"basket\", the comprehensive development of the rural economy, and to ensure the effective supply of agricultural and sideline products, farmers&#39; income increased steadily and social stability in rural areas. Perfect policy. Good grasp of grain and cotton production, increase investment in agriculture, good grain and cotton purchase and sale of a specific demand. Confidence. China&#39;s agriculture is facing good opportunities for the development of society as a whole is more and more attention to agriculture, solid work to implement the plan, the agriculture to a new level, creating a new situation. <br>'
