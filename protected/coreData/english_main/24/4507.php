Some of the best, most wise emperor would be their courtiers betrayed (history today. Com) and fell to their corruption - Diocletian <br> if the allows you to see in Salou that I personally planted cabbage, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) you must not Zaiquan to forgo immediate joy - the Diocletian declined Maxi Damian please He reset <br> once hung, as the world of the Roman Empire, finally entering a period of unprecedented chaos that followed the end of the Severus dynasty, known as the \"crisis of the third century, the ruling clique of civil strife, endless infighting, slave and scribe farmers once intifada display them on the political forces. As the Illyrians Austrian column benign Yunus (reigned 270-275 years) came to power, to take a substantial absorption of barbarians into the Roman army practice began of course to eliminate civil strife, restore a unified, while the completion of this course, Rome to enter a new stage of development, based on another important figure - Diocletian came to power as a symbol. The Diocletian father <br> Illyrians, a freed slave, Diocletian&#39;s son of the origin of a lower working people to participate in the armed forces, the rise in A military being. 284 years, has accumulated the military merit promotion to the post of the heads of the Roman Empire Kalu Si pro Guard captain. <br> 284 calories Spirax one of his sons Cali Yunus to Gaul to suppress local resistance, while he is with another son Noumea Leah Magnus expedition Persian.

OpenCourseWare Meanwhile, in Gaul of Cali Magnus also declared himself successor to the heads of state of the place, so the two sides launch a decisive battle, Cali Yunus decisive when men kill Diocletian Empire&#39;s only rule persons. <br> since Octavian after the establishment of the heads of state of the system, the governing body of the Roman republic to autocratic monarchy changes Diocletian first to finalize this process. Under his reign, the senate is deprived of the last bit of the real power completely became honorary furnishings. He changed the title of the head of state Duominusi (meaning mainly person), became a name match the reality of the emperor in Rome (Because of this, in this book, Diocletian before the supreme ruler of the Roman Empire is called The heads of state, Diocletian later known as Emperor). Courtesy of oriental despotism, he will be ported to the court, to fully enjoy the majesty of the emperor and Jupiter God to deify himself. an Eastern Complex the <br> Diocletian always, he will be in incurred determine Nike Mi Lydia in Asia Minor, Rome only retain nominal capital position, which makes him more completely to get rid of control of the old forces, but also a big change in the history of Rome. The Roman Empire was largely stabilized, but the situation remains tense parts. Diocletian focused on the management of the east, they put empire west entrusted to his friend Maxi Hashemian, in 286 years, he was promoted to equal status with their \"Augustus\", the two Royal Total governance still feel powerless, he picked up each appoint a deputy, the Jialieliya and Jun Stearns West Asia, known as \"Caesar\", two \"Augustus\" his daughter marry to Caesar, and the establishment of \"Caesar\" as his successor. Four of delineation of the specific rule of the scope of Diocletian responsible for most eastern end of the Empire of Thrace, Asia Minor and Egypt. Diocletian still held supreme power among the four. The four Emperor Diocletian&#39;s co-governance system is a major undertaking, and is conducive to strengthening the rule of performance and also foreshadowed future split of the Roman Empire. <br> Diocletian in the east to suppress the uprising of the Egyptians, and compete for Armenia and Mesopotamia battle with the Persians, the last part of Mesopotamia. The other three rule by their own jurisdictions success. Empire stable unified consolidate down, but also to expand the territory, four Imperial rule system in its early shows good results. <br> Diocletian Empire province of reforms 47 provinces divided into 100 Administrative Region established in the province above 100 provinces belong to the 12 administrative districts. Militarily, the army is divided into border guards and the Mainland Tactical Unit, at the same time a large number of absorption of the \"barbarians\" of the frontier into the army being expanded to a total strength of 600,000, the Roman army further barbarians. <br> various reforms of Diocletian, the most far-reaching impact on future generations is the change in the tax system, and the promulgation of the decree to accommodate this change. In the early Roman Empire, the main source of revenue is the indirect tax, income tax and commodity transaction tax is the country&#39;s economic lifeblood. But the catastrophe of the 3rd century, the Roman economy greatly fading, and an easy target city suffered greater losses, commercial and handicraft greatly shrink the economy to the agriculture of the natural economy a big step backwards. Response to this change, in order to expand the tax revenue, Diocletian implementation of the new tax law, the original tax system turned to be the main direct taxes to indirect taxes based kind based in the rural levy a poll tax and land tax, imposed by the city currency-based poll tax. In order to ensure the sources of tax revenue, Diocletian promulgated the Decree fixation, the farmers and scribe agricultural land, shall not migratory, traders and artisans fixed in the industry, and shall not be diverted, fixed on the City Council to the city council. These measures, apparently the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages, a major step forward. In order to stabilize the continuous depreciation of the currency to curb inflation, Diocletian change the monetary system and enacted measures to limit Act, but to no avail, and finally gave up this effort, relying on the kind of taxes and supply means commodity economy continues to be difficult to reverse the natural economic retrogression. <br> Diocletian in the religious aspects of the action compelling. Jupiter God, his thrall, claiming to be the Son of God Jupiter. The face of an increasingly prosperous Christian, Diocletian deeply disturbed, promulgated by Royal Decree 303, prohibiting Christian religious ceremonies, the Christians excluded from the ranks of the army and officials, the destruction of the Christian church, and the confiscation of the property of the Church of Christ, some stubborn Christians were killed. This is the largest in the history of the development of Christianity in Europe by persecution, but also has its darkness before dawn last. the <br> 305, Diocletian&#39;s reign of 20 years, in accordance with the original agreement, he abdicated and Maxi Damian \"Caesar\" inherit their position by two. The Diocletian become a voluntary abdication of the monarch in the history of Rome. May 24 <br> AD 312, Diocletian died in his palace, aged sixty-year-old. <br> Rome first formal emperor Diocletian established majesty emperor eminence, but his life do not change a tireless warrior and focus on the true nature of the actual politicians. Maybe things in the world Rise and Fall of ups and downs are a set number, after the blow of the crisis of the third century, the Roman Empire had to bid farewell to the heyday of the stage, on the decline of no return. Diocletian did not change this trend, but after all, he led the Empire and entered a strong phase of nearly a hundred years. Diocletian&#39;s reform involves the range is very wide, in fact three centuries all the changes in the Roman world, active or passive adaptation, some of which have far-reaching significance, such as the four-Emperor common governance regime and tax economic reforms. His reign laid the groundwork for the larger changes soon after Constantine the Great. In summary, he ranked in the Top 62. <br> Comments: Compared to many reforms in the history of Diocletian&#39;s reforms are more important to adapt to the reality of imperial decline. Unprecedented \"four Royal rule by\" system to adapt to the border crisis-ridden situation, reform of the tax system to adapt to the situation of the proportion of natural economy expanding. Diocletian&#39;s reforms to establish a relatively stable social and political system, but the long-term trend for the fall of Rome, there is no effect. <br>'
