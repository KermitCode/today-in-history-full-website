'cont'=>'(Rat June ninth day), July 24, 1996, Australian astronomers estimated the age of the universe 11 billion years old. the Large Magellanic Cloud, <br> nebula clusters NGC1850 <br> 1996, Australia astronomers confirmed that the universe is not as old as people think, but to be younger than the original estimate of 50 billion years . the Observatory after <br> Australian National University to prove the long-term observations of the southern sky nebula, the age of the universe than people originally estimated young 1/3. Past the astronomical community generally believed that the age of the oldest stars in the universe between of 14O 100000000-16000000000 years. Strom Dora Observatory, Australian National University 1000 million stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, observations, and focus was observed in 70 of the more than 8,000 known pulsars. <br> Professor Rogers, who led the study said, according to the age of the pulsar, and it emits a pulse signal, the scientists can calculate its mass, according to the quality and temperature of the pulses, they can calculate its brightness. The scientists calculated the pulsar brightness observed brightness contrast to correct observation errors caused by cosmic dust absorbs light, a result, they found that the of these pulsars brightness than people think 70% higher. <br> Rogers said, which means that these stars much younger than previously estimated, according to their calculations, the age of the universe is 11 billion years, he said, this finding is correct astronomical model to predict the universe fate has important significance. <br> scientists based on the quality and brightness of the stars will be able to calculate the amount of hydrogen consumed by the internal nuclear reactions, thus deduce its age. Their findings confirmed the inference of the Hubble Constant: The age of the universe should be 9000000000-12000000000. <br>'
