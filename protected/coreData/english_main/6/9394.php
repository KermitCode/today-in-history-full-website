This is the first planet found outside the solar system, which is regarded as the most important astronomical discoveries of recent decades. <br> According to reports, the newly discovered stars takes the shape of liquid structure, dark red, volume equivalent of Jupiter (1,000 times Earth&#39;s), only 10-20 light-years from Earth). It is located in a star attached Carpenter Pegasus constellation No. 51, and No. 51 Star rotation around at breakneck speed, the rotation period of only four days. The Pegasus constellation of star No. 51 is not only similar to the sun, and their formation ages 3 billion more than the sun, astronomy school say, is likely to have other Earth-like planets around it. This further strengthens presumably extrasolar life and civilization. it around the bright star <br> newly discovered \"drowned\". Currently, through any telescope in the world can not see it.
