'cont'=>'(Jiashen leap April 16), June 6, 1944, the Allies landed in Normandy. the <br> Allied occupation after the beachhead, (lsjt.org) landing army as flood flocked <br> 1944, there are still three months away from the implementation of the amphibious landing, Eisenhower command to abandon the bombing of Germany itself, pouring all the bombs on the German concentrated in the west of France. At the same time, the Allies launched a series of deception operations aimed at the German produce the illusion, the main forces and focus on Calais direction. Develop Overlord battle plan as early as in 1943, the Allies faced with two choices: or landed in Calais region, or landed in Normandy. Port of Calais from Dunkirk Harbour close to the brink of the narrowest point in the English Channel, just 30 a few kilometers from the Strait British side of the Dover to Calais, the Allied departure from Dover, England, can be Da Jialai landing area to the fastest speed in the shortest possible distance, but it is actually the strongest areas of the German garrison forces, by contrast, arrived in the Normandy region across a channel from the British coast, although the voyage more than 100 kilometers, but beachhead geographical environment is ideal for landing, and the force of the German garrison in the region is relatively weak, so the Allies eventually landing direction given in the Normandy region. Allied was faced with two choices the Germans faced two judgments: Calais? Normandy, and they preconceptions that Calais direction is more dangerous, after all, thousands of years ago, Britain and France, is connected to the land connection location is the UK Dover and Calais, France, and later submerged land bridge before breaking open, but the formation of the trench is the narrowest point of the Strait. The head of the German machinery, it is difficult to imagine there will detour the street that crossed the sea from the Strait. In order to enhance the illusion of the German, Allied Air Force each to Normandy throwing tons of bombs dropped two tons of bombs to Calais; each reconnaissance aircraft sent to Normandy, and sent two to Calais. Calais facing Dover, UK. Allied busy building barracks, warehouses, railway lines, pipeline pressure stations have started in Dover, action seriously exaggerated, as if you really want to initiate positions Dover to Calais offensive. Barton was sent to Dover commanding a nominal Legion, The Rommel&#39;s old rival, daily from Dover in front on the mainland Calais plan than gestures really like to be there with Rommel goodbye a level of up and down. Allied high command by radio to Calais direction hypothetical underground organization issued an order to all the requirements proposed to coordinate the Allied landing. German adept at the to diligently collect information, and a card index-thinking, Allied disinformation manufactured without a heritage open record. Finally, the the Germans west line headquarters gingerly up the hook, Lun Side and Rommel are convinced the Allied landing in Calais. The documents seized after the war, the Hitler Daohai no completely hooked, for outsiders can not alien intuition, he repeatedly yelling, pay attention to the Normandy! Landing operations windless weather and favorable tides. German meteorological department forecast that the best time of the Allied attack in 1944, May and into June, the bad weather. But throughout May, the Allies did not move to the end of May, the West Line Command greatly relieved. The fact is that at the end of May, dispersing concentrated in the port of departure of the Allied officers and men of the British Isles and war materiel to standby. To this end, within a few days, every road leading to the port, quartering two years of war materiel to be shipped out the same night. Army implemented strict security measures: foreign envoys prohibited access ports in the UK; unchecked letters shall not be sent; unrelated persons shall not be involved in a radius of 10 miles of the coastline. the most senior commanders of the Allied <br> the eve of the Normandy landings the meeting <br> work June 1, British ports were filled. 3000 warships, carrying above 2000 small landing craft, 1,500 tanks, 5,000 armored vehicles, 10,000 jeeps and bulldozers, as well as the first batch of 250,000 troops landing. The personnel concentrated, but gradually concentrated across the Channel to cumulonimbus, they clip with a strong low pressure gradually approaching. Up at the sky, Churchill said gloomily: \"This can truly is fatalistic. Bad weather, the storm came. Warships moored in the harbor on their feet, not to be starting, there are a large number of people were seasick. Allied High Command, originally scheduled for June 5 for the D-Day, the day Allied forces broke out in the west coast of France and the German, Allied landing forces with the German garrison energize, second front opened up the flag, but D Day had to be postponed. According to the original plan, the June 4, Allied ship fleet has been driving out of the harbor. The Strait Bailangtaotian, turbulence, winds on the sea roar, and the fleet gone half the distance by seaplane recall. D-Day to postpone the day, June 5, according to the meteorological department report, the storm will be in the morning of June 6, temporarily stopped. Eisenhower short write-write to say: \"OK, we hit the road,\" fleet second into the choppy Strait. Clouds clouds hung low on the days the other side of the vast sea, the patch of mist falls, and is looking forward to both a long \"second front\". Normandy in northern France, a region that contains several provinces, the Allied landing sites is only the Seine Bay broke into the Strait of short coastline. Prior to the arrival of the landing force, at 1 o&#39;clock on June 6 to 3:00 men traveling 925 aircraft, 13,000 paratroopers behind German positions airborne, they belong to two U.S. Airborne Division and a British Airborne Division, the task is to contain Germans to stop the Germans to reinforce the beachhead, and to seize the important places, to establish a bridgehead. They opened a prelude to Operation Overlord. But the the Overlord actions of the protagonist the landing force rather than served by the paratroopers, when Allied paratroopers behind enemy lines with the German exchange of fire when landing army still floating in the Strait. The German patrol boats did not go out to sea due to bad weather, so the Nazis actually did not even notice, and a history of the largest transport fleet forward coming. After dawn on June 6, 2500 Allied bombers began bombing the Germans guarding the 80 km long beach, \"the Atlantic fortress\" blow start. Guns fierce cover of artillery fire, the Allies landed in Normandy coast, a lot of confusion because of the big waves, the first landing. Designed and manufactured specifically for this landing amphibious tanks, have many soon was drowned into the water. After the commencement of the Allied landing operations, the the Germans west line headquarters still insist that in such bad weather, it is not possible to have any decent large-scale offensive. Allied bombing, airborne, landing just a feint, the true location of the attack in Calais. Rommel Where was Battle of El Alamein, when D-Day comes, he is not in the military, and at home. But his effort in the the Atlantic fortress \"under paid. After such a violent bombing and shelling, even 80% of the fortifications preserved and effectively to the Allied beachhead forces opened fire, and say that this is the the beachhead forces of disaster. The most unlucky Omaha Beach, based on prior intelligence the defenders here as a battalion, but the U.S. military rushed beachhead discovered that they face a well-equipped German divisions, heavy casualties on U.S. forces in the beachhead . U.S. Army Colonel Taylor then stay on this beachhead was later widely spread: only two kinds of people: \"This beachhead has died and is waiting for a dead person. Or follow me break the hell of it! Participate landing British Legion, the official named \"British People&#39;s Liberation Army, the British people are more willing to call it\" revenge Army, landed in Calais direction, they will almost down then the Dunkirk retreat routes backtrack fight back. Now landed in Normandy, they have to show the England national spirit of resurrection. Up to 80 kilometers of the coast is not all of the beach, the landing of the Canadian Forces, the lot is steep cliffs. Because of the big waves, landing vessels rely not shore. Germans the first to climb on the cliffs, condescending to shoot, the Canadian Forces can only deal with the Germans in the rocks between passive, later, higher than other beaches this place, he was known as the \"trap\" of Normandy. When the evening of June 6, Eisenhower and Montgomery touched his head, fighting is not satisfactory, the provisions of the D-Day objectives to be achieved, but also did not reach. But in the entire D-Day, the Allied death toll is less than 2,500. June 7, the British split cast concrete artificial port was shipped to the beaches of Normandy, it by concrete caisson and floating dock is composed of two parts, is also known as mulberry artificial Port. It moored in deep water along the coast, small transport ships and landing craft direct berthing war materiel through an 8 km long by pontoon the road delivered directly to shore. Have never been a half-century of June storm swept. Dozens of ships have been left on the beach, dozens of ships to the bottom of the sea. Artificial pier was not able to withstand the test of storm waves to the disintegration of the millions of dollars in weapons from falling into the water, the big ships moored in the sea, although there is no wind and waves knocked contained in supplements can not be delivered to shore . <br> World War II in the largest amphibious landing combat <br> storm suddenly go suddenly. The weather was fine, the road was muddy, Allied travel difficulties. Was not any in the storm that comes up a few days, the supplies brought up the part of the Allies is now stuck. God gave the Germans a rare counterattack opportunities. After the war, the Western World War II, experts agree that Rommel was not able to seize this fighter. But in any event, the Germans have captured many Allied soldiers. In a few areas, due to the Allied bombing of the French civilians lost the house, barn, property, and some anger pouring the Allied prisoners who. But in a wider range, in western France, the countless underground organization from the ground to take out with the Allied combat. Normandy landing operations gradually to a climax, the last scene is to seize the Ketan Deng Peninsula on the ancient fortress and important commercial port - Cherbourg, Allied forces fighting in western France, can not always rely on the beach and artificial port loading and unloading supplies, and must have a ready-made excuse for the port. Normandy Cherbourg became the preferred target. <br> Hitler to Cherbourg garrison under a death order: not allowed to retreat! No surrender! He Cherbourg defenders for a suicidal battle. The defenders here many employment to German soldiers are not mercenaries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans uninterested. Cherbourg is a small town of only tens of thousands of people, the three divisions of the U.S. military in one fell swoop jump Ruketandeng Peninsula, 40 km wide peninsula into two halves. Cherbourg garrison, to support him, and that did not play well, mainly due to the forces ingredients too complex Cherbourg city defense commander captured. He said: \"You can not count on an Eastern Europe or the Balkans, in the land of the Frenchman, the interests of the German, and with the Americans and the British desperately,\" he then quickly confirmed. June 26, Cherbourg only a stronghold, (lssdjt.cn) naval armory. Where some arms and ammunition, as well as 8 feet thick concrete fortifications. If the defending side is willing to adhere to, it can persist in a while. However, the U.S. military sent a psychological warfare team, with a microphone array, then shouting to the armory defenders. Little while, the armory commander out of negotiations. He said: \"We surrendered to the cannon, we can not surrender to that microphone. To face off on the microphone, then play a few guns over. Go back, \"he U.S. military to fulfill the formalities, put a few guns. Instantly, 400 defenders lined collective surrender. June 27, a full three weeks after the date of D, the Allied occupation of Cherbourg, it is considered to be the most important achievements of the Normandy landings. Although this harbor has been German destruction to the point can not be used, but the Allied experts in just 19 days to repair the harbor, and ushered in the first ship. <br>'
