'cont'=>'February 6, 2001 (month 14) Government House, the scientists successfully cloned Opalescence teeth Gene. <br> February 2001, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that, through positional cloning of the way, the two agencies have recently succeeded in cloning a hereditary opalescent dentin type II gene. The two institutions are the State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular hospital, Shanghai Research Institute of Biological Engineering Research Center and the Chinese Medical Science Institute of Basic Medical. The results show that our in oral genetic disease research, as well as human genetic disease genes positional cloning field to make significant progress. <br> the saying goes, toothache is not a disease, pain up to life. Dental seriously affect people&#39;s quality of life. Hereditary opalescent dental oral is the most common genetic disease incidence in 1/6000-1/8000. Such patients dentin mineralization defects, crowns can detach, causing the teeth to severe wear. In this regard, no effective drug treatment. Shanghai and other places, scientists, and through four hereditary opalescent dentin home in the Department of the analysis, (Lssdjt.com) found in the long arm of chromosome 4 the DSSP gene product played in dentin development and inner ear normal functions provide useful clues to the role, and brings hope for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> study of two papers published simultaneously in Nature Genetics journal, published in February 2001 an international reputation. International counterparts: this important result strongly suggests that, with the rapid progress of the human genome, the human genetic disease genes \"positional cloning\" is no longer the monopoly of the Western scientific community. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> This outcome is a crystallization of a mass collaboration. The participating units across South and North China, participants including medical scientists, participating units Tianjin Medical University, No. 82 (lssjt.cn) People&#39;s Liberation Army Hospital, Yangpu District Central Hospital, University of Science and Technology of China, Fourth Military Medical University throat Rhinology Shanghai Eye and Ear Hospital, National Center for Gene Research and the National Human Genome North and Southern Research Center of Fudan University. <br>'
