'cont'=>'December 6, 1945 (Yiyou years of winter and the beginning of two), microwave come out. ， Spencer of <br> Peixi \"target =\" _blank \"> microwave. come out with his invention of the microwave oven <br> 1945 12 6, microwave advent, protected by patents. microwave a use of microwave radiation to kitchen utensils for cooking and heating food., the world&#39;s largest microwave oven manufacturer Galanz cooking food <br> using microwave method is the first by the the office Raytheon Peixi ， History Bin think of race, Peixi ， Spencer in the past for the construction of the radar equipment magnetron day he is working on a startup radar equipment, suddenly found himself on the pocket chocolate melted by Peixi ， ; Spencer&#39;s thinking and research, found that his chocolate microwave to melt, so that the magnetron can be used for cooking. principle of <br> operation of the microwave oven by using microwave (frequency often to 2.45 GHz) food irradiation, food molecules can be divided into polar molecules and non-polar molecules the original haphazard distribution of external electric field, polar molecules along the direction of the external electric field to produce steering polarization; Promise molecular displacement polarization direction of the external electric field. reforming the outer direction of the electric field, the molecules steering polarization or the displacement direction of polarization changed. microwave work, the food is placed in the furnace, in the microwave (high-frequency alternating electromagnetic field) under the action of the food molecules per second Economy pole 2.4 billion times, when a collision between the molecules, the friction of the electromagnetic energy is converted to heat (i.e. wobble) so that it can make the food within a very short time, the interior and exterior temperature is also increased, to achieve rapid heating without destruction of the food contained a variety of vitamins and nutrients beneficial to human body, and the bright color and delicious taste, not cooked phenomenon. <br> Comments: very practical and convenient household appliances. <br>'
