'cont'=>'April 6, 1928 (Boshin leap February 16), the double helix structure of DNA, James Dewey Watson was born. <br> <br> James Dewey Watson was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Watson (English: James Dewey Watson 6, 2008 - April 1928) American molecular biologist, molecular biology in the 20th century, one of the lead person. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) and colleagues Francis Crick because co-discovered the double helix structure of DNA, with Morris ¡¤ Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. <br> James Watson was born in Chicago, a lot of influence by his father, he said in an article, that the father of three the item true mass: First, I believe that knowledge can make people ask every thing from the \"superstition\" (ie religious);, love birdwatching; Third, the Democratic twelve years old, attending a \"child\" ( Quiz Quiz Kids) radio, the 15-year-old&#39;s identity for the purpose of eugenics early admission to the University of Chicago, majoring in zoology read physicist Schrodinger science classics \"What is life?\" (What is Life?) interests by migratory birds to the genetics. <br> Girard large degree, has applied for admission to Caltech, Harvard Institute, not fruit, improved Indiana University, joined the Salvador Lew Calabria (Salvador Luria) \"phage group\", the official involved in the study of genetics. affected by the Group (on www.TodayOnHistory.com) Watson began to believe that DNA is the carrier of the gene. Ph.D. in 1950 to Copenhagen for a post-doctoral research, during which participate in an academic conference in Naples, the structure of DNA with rules learned from Maurice Vail Hopkins, (Maurice Wilkins) speech that strengthened his determination to solve the structure of DNA 1951, go to Cambridge&#39;s Cavendish Laboratory, recognizing Crick, with the use of X-ray diffraction data to construct the model of DNA. finally, two in the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, in April of the same year 25, 2009 the results were published in \"Nature\" magazine., <br> 1956 Watson to Harvard University, a teaching assistant, was promoted to professor in 1961. Creek, Vail Hopkins in 1962, and because of the structure of DNA research shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. the landmark textbook gene Molecular Biology (Molecular Biology of the Gene), published in 1965, the \"double helix\" was published in 1968, the same year began to serve in Long Island, New York, Cold Spring Harbor Explorer of the the real risks chamber (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), and the research direction shifted to the cancer. resign from the post of Harvard in 1976, focus on the duties at Cold Spring Harbor in 1988, by the U.S. National Health Council appointed as the assistant director of the Human Genome Project a year later became the first head of the National Center for Human Genome Research, held this office until 1994, 1992. become first president of Cold Spring Harbor. <br> Review: the pioneer of modern molecular biology Gangster academic authority enough to describe. <br>'
