'cont'=>'December 6, 1986 (Bingyin years of winter and the beginning of five), sediment scientist Channing&#39;s death. <br> Channing expert to study sediment foundation theory, the pioneers of sediment scientific research in China, who make a significant contribution to the cause of China&#39;s water conservancy construction. In order to explore the law of motion of the Yellow River sediment, from the mid-1950s to the late 1970s, he and his colleagues around the life and work of the shore of the Yellow River 10 years on The coarse sediment topics unique insights, sediment movement mechanics and riverbed evolution Transcend. <br> Channing was born in 1922 to study in the United States in 1947, under the guidance of the son of the famous physicist Albert Einstein, sediment authority Professor Einstein, assiduously, to obtain a doctorate. They jointly published numerous scientific papers, including some of the conclusions in many countries of the sediment scholars refer to and their movable bed sediment simulation test method is called \"Einstein - Channing method. Channing, 30-year-old just in his early budding the sediment scholars in the United States. However, the young scholars know the motherland river sediment problem serious sediment laboratory at the University of California, engaged in research as early as when he secretly set a vow: and come back to serve the country. <br> founding of New China, Channing gave up the superior work and living conditions in the United States, overcome difficulties, and returned to the motherland in 1955. In the late 1950s, the Sanmenxia Reservoir and Liujiaxia Hydropower Station commenced construction, the governance of the lower reaches of the Yellow River is very urgent, Channing best part of these work. In order to obtain first-hand information of the Yellow River, he and colleagues in from Zhengzhou nearby Huayuankou starting tracking the Yellow River into the sea, no less than 10 times, almost every corner of the important tributaries of the Yellow River. In the billowing Yellow turbidites, Channing while listening to old skipper about the river situation, while observing the immediate reach: some places river broad and shallow water scattered sandbars lot, some places narrow and deep river, mainstream normalized Beach Chau rare. Channing repeatedly thinking: Why so different? By comparison, he finally found a regular flow, because of the prominent spur, the vulnerable spot engineering and the natural form of the bend in the river bank to play embedded guided stream role. He named this natural or artificial water control point node. Through a large number of experiments, Channing develop the planning of the use of man-made \"nodes\" rectification of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. In-depth investigation, Channing made the voice of the Sanmenxia Reservoir the downstream riverbed may change problem, his master wealth of information on the basis of theoretical summary of the evolution of the river, written after returning The monographs riverbed evolution of the lower reaches of the Yellow River \", and therefore known as the Yellow experts. In 1982, he concluded the calendar year to participate in the experience of the Yellow River in the work, written in \"the relevant departments attach great importance to the views of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Governance\", one of the key recommendations are considered the \"governance of the Yellow River a major breakthrough in the understanding.\" . This article won the National Natural Science Award. 1983 Channing published millions of words of sediment movement mechanics monograph by the silt workers and water conservancy workers praise, National Outstanding Book Award, translated and published by the University of Iowa, USA. <br> Channing is not only an outstanding scientist, is also an excellent educator, he trained a large number of sediment workers, dedicated his entire life to China&#39;s scientific and educational undertakings. December 6, 1986, the tragic death of his suffering from cancer. <br>'
