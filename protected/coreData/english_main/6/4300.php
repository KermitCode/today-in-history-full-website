In 1/3 and 2/3 of the auxiliary tunnel, tunnel construction for both operators lateral connection tunnel. Railway failure, the trains run in the side of the tunnel may be transferred to another tunnel continue to run without interruption throughout the tunnel operations. In the assisted tunneling online, every 375 meters, has a channel connected to the two main tunnels, so that maintenance personnel and personnel in case of an emergency evacuation. enabled <br> tunnel to shorten the London to Paris overland travel time in half, three hours to arrive. Voyage usually takes about three hours to fly from London to Paris. While also booking in advance through the tunnel by train, time, but save a lot of trouble.
