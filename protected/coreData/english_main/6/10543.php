Three partition of Poland, the greedy polar bear is divided into 46 more than 10,000 square kilometers of land. <br> Peter the Great reign could not complete the desire to open up the Black Sea to the sea, Turkey is always the number one imaginary enemy of Tsarist Russia. Ekaterina era war against Turkey was surprisingly smooth. In 1768, the Russian tease, Turkey declared war on Russia, originally preached a one-sided advantage in Russia, that was a close contest in the victory for the Danube, Crimea, the Caucasus and the Aegean four fronts, Peace Treaty in 1774, Turkey in addition to cede territory and pay indemnities, also forced to admit that the Crimean Khanate independent (after the Russian annexation), and recognize the Russian merchant ships can freely enter and leave the Black Sea to the sea. <br> Turkey naturally refused to let go, both sides are preparing for war.

Once mighty Ottoman Empire in West Asia sick man reduced to being trampled upon in the process, Catherine is the biggest catalyst. (On www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> there is a small episode in the second Russian-Turkish War, the Swedish actor King Gustav would like to seize the opportunity to attack Russia&#39;s Baltic Fleet, the results defeat and go. Sweden, Poland and Turkey have been the three main target of Russia&#39;s expansion in Europe, in the reign of Catherine the total victory. <br> looked greatly expanded Russian territory, Catherine lofty said: \"If I could live to be two hundred years old, all of Europe will prostrate at my feet!\" <br> Catherine has long had read the works of many Western European Enlightenment thinkers, in the popular \"enlightened despotism\" era, she also become fashionable Chaser, ascended the throne after the close correspondence with Voltaire Contact has also funded through the \"Encyclopedia of the representatives of the faction\" Diderot. She set up all types of schools, advocated literary creation, to take a policy to encourage the development of capitalist industry and commerce, the abolition of restrictions on trade, but hot after sitting in the Czar despotism throne, her mind gradually changed. peasant uprising led by posing Tsar Peter III Pugachev <br> 1773 lasted a year and more on the suppression of it, but not occupied important strategic significance of the major cities, but still make the Queen feel a huge shock. She further strengthen the centralization of power, such as to change the provincial, state, county, three-tier system for the two-tier system of the provincial, county, and to give greater powers of aristocracy more, 1787 issued by the Russian aristocracy freedom and privileges edict \"epitomizes She also is known as the\" noble Queen. In this regard, although beneficial in the short term to consolidate his rule, but in the long term, exacerbated the aristocratic serf-owners and serf class Contradictory exploitation and oppression suffered by the serfs further deepened. Serfdom has been a chronic problem in the Russian society, Catherine II, exacerbated it and to solve this thorny pushed to her offspring. <br> the other hand, given more freedom in the aristocratic, so advanced molecular and full access to the liberal ideas of Western Europe, to open a door for Russia&#39;s modernization. The overthrow of the tsarist autocracy and serfdom in Russia the First Shout is issued from the progressive nobility. <br> Ekaterina is said to be very romantic, famous among her lover Gregory Orlov, wave gold, Poniatowski them at different times Ekaterina cause more brilliant. However, compared with the three Nvsha Huang before her, she may also not dissolute and shameless. <br> All in all, Catherine II history is mainly reflected in the changes in the international structure and layout. Her rapidly fading Poland disappeared and Turkey, while Russia more powerful, the dominant force further approaching the heart of Europe, the era of the Napoleonic wars in the upcoming invincible. The mighty Nvsha Huang ranks 39th in the rankings. <br> Review: Catherine II during the early years of frustration had freedom, equality, fraternity Enlightenment thought had a great love, but when she took the helm, but it became a maintenance of the old system and the privileged class \"noble Queen. The same situation appear in the body of her grandson Alexander I and her contemporaries Prussian King Frederick II. Outstanding politicians they are very informative, but they ultimately strengthen the autocratic form of the most conducive to their own rule, and this perhaps explains, the emperors after all difficult to become the leading force in the push history forward. <br>'
