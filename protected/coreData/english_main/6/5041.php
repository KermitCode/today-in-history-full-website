'cont'=>'(Heigo April 18), June 6, 1966, the unmanned spacecraft photographed the lunar surface photo. satellite&#39;s protective cabin <br> failed to docking with Gemini <br> 1966 on June 6, 2009, the United States space program was a small failure, but at the same time it has made a big success. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) astronaut Eugene - Saier Nan and Thomas - Staffordshire Gemini 9 with satellite docking, Saier Nan has real space floating line for two hours, and today they failed to get splashdown in maritime security. The same time, the detection security in the 1st, the 2nd landed on the moon and send back photos shows the lunar surface is covered with gravel, but very flat. This landing is planned for the United States in 1970 years ago, man landed on the moon is an important step. Probe in a few hours after the moon landing, and sent back 144 photographs of the Earth, the lunar surface is flat, and strong enough to support a manned landing spacecraft. Detection by the success of the No. 1 for the scientists who designed and built the spacecraft, it is an additional incentive.

Robert-F-Jia Balin, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), said: \"In my opinion, the explorer plans to complete at least one year in advance. Detection by the use of radar, a computer and four rocket engine, with its three-legged support falling gently. It draws power from the solar battery plate, is expected to send back every day hundreds of photos. <br>'
