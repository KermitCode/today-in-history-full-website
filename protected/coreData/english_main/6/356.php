'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'January 6, 1997 (27 Rat in the winter months), the first time in the world to successfully build a full map of the rice genome physical. <br> 1997, the State Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Government of Shanghai Academic Activities Center held a joint news conference to announce: Chinese scientists have successfully constructed the world&#39;s first full map of the rice genome physical This is another major breakthrough achieved by the country in the field of life sciences. <br> Guo-Fan Hong researcher under the leadership of the National Center for Gene Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences after three years of hard work, the use of the complete rice chromosome 12 BAC library was successfully constructed the world&#39;s first high-resolution rice physical full map of the genome. This achievement made by Chinese scientists in the Rice Genome Research Program study, made a significant contribution to eventually reveal the mysteries and crop breeding of rice genetic information. <br> rice genome consists of 12 chromosomes, with a total length of 430 million nucleotide in rice genome research program includes three genetic map of the rice genome physical map and DNA full-sequence determination. Carry out the rice genome research in Japan, [lssjt.cn] (l $ j而.c里) United States, [lssjt.cn] (l $ j而.c里) India, [lssjt.cn] (l $ j而.c里) Korea, [lssjt.cn] (l $ j而.c里) Philippines and other countries, Japan was in 1994, first constructed a genetic map of the rice genome, so that the rice genome physical map construction became the commanding heights of the field of battle. <br> Rice Genome Research Program, the physical map is the connecting status, based on the physical map can not only lay the foundation for the mystery of all the genetic information for the final unlock rice by positional cloning and other variety of modern technology, efficient and system important genes and related information required for agricultural genetics and breeding. Our constructed the physical map of the rice genome is characterized by: (1) resolution (scale) of 120,000 nucleotides. This high resolution makes the whole DNA sequencing directly, while simplifying the steps to obtain the desired gene; (2) contains 565 genetic molecular markers, many physical distance between markers have been measured, which will greatly speed up access to the Wo cereal crop genes required speed; (3) contains nearly 100 common genetic molecular markers, genetic molecular markers in the genome of the six major crops such as barley, wheat, oats, corn, sorghum, sugar cane is generic. Therefore, the physical map of the rice genome will have a significant role to build on agricultural genetics and breeding. researcher in <br> Guo-Fan Hong report that the outcome of the recent meeting of the International Rice Molecular Biology meeting, has aroused strong repercussions, many scholars take the initiative expressed willingness to further cooperation with Chinese scientists.
