'cont'=>'December 6, 1989 (Baba winter of early nine), one of the first transgenic rabbit come out. early <br> 1989 12, (lssjt.cn) of animal genetic engineering research significant progress: scientists use genetic engineering techniques to contain the genes of the hepatitis B virus and human growth hormone gene into rabbit fertilized egg, received the first batch of transgenic rabbits containing the exogenous gene. <br> success of this study, breaking most of the animals can not be sexual hybridization barriers, nurturing ideal species for other species contained in the fine genetically modified species-specific, is of great significance. when <br> researchers, to conduct transgenic rabbits, is the first hepatitis B virus surface antigen gene, the male pronucleus injected into rabbits fertilized egg through the microscope, and then moved into the receptor females of the fallopian tubes into the uterus until childbirth a transgenic rabbits. After the determination of molecular hybridization and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, rabbits infected hepatitis B surface antigen gene and its product can be found in the blood of transgenic rabbits born offspring rabbit. This indicates that this exogenous gene already present in the genome of transgenic rabbits, expression and genetic. <br>'
