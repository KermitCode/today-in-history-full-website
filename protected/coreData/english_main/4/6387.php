'cont'=>'July 4, 2002 (May 24), Horse, Yellow River water and sediment regulation for the first time. the 4th, <br> 7 Yellow River water and sediment regulation test for the first time. In July 2002, at 9 pm sharp, With the order, many of the Yellow River Xiaolangdi Reservoir gate turn slowly rising, the different aspects of the huge water diversion tunnel spewing out, toward the lower reaches of the Yellow River riverbed. The official start of the Yellow River the first large-scale experiment on water and sediment regulation. This is by far the largest in the history of the World Water Conservancy artificial prototype test. <br> this test, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir regulation of water and sediment, change the imbalance in the water and sediment to the water and sediment balance, form water potential of the riverbed scouring, the future long-term use of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir and downstream river sedimentation reduction to provide the scientific data in order to achieve the the riverbed elevation \"Yellow River in goals. <br> Yellow River flows through the Loess Plateau, a year into the lower reaches of the Yellow River silt up to 1.6 billion tons, of which 400 million tons are deposited in the river bed, resulting in downstream river siltation uplift an average annual rate of 10 cm, the lower reaches of the Yellow River to form on the ground hanging river. To reduce siltation, pursued the goal of the ancient Yellow River in experts. Years of research show that the lower reaches of the Yellow River floods greater than 2500 cubic meters per second, together with other relevant factors to be able to play on downstream riverbed scouring action, thereby reducing the Yellow River siltation even reach the erosion and deposition balance, which fundamentally curb The riverbed uplift. the <br> Yellow River water and sediment regulation is an extremely complex system engineering to fully predict reservoir storage, river runoff, the water regime of the future such as weather forecast, but also consider small Xiaolangdi dam downstream to the mouth of nearly 1,000 km of riverbed erosion, siltation, engineering Chuxian engineering conditions, in water and sediment regulation process, the two sides diversion, evaporation, floodplains, and sediment washed factors are the need for a large number of scientific analysis and calculation parties actively cooperate. To this end, the flow of the water and sediment regulation test sediment concentration control indicators, and years of research by scientists to determine Huayuankou section 2600 cubic meters per second, Aishan Section 2300 cubic meters per second, sandy The amount does not exceed 20 kilograms per cubic meter. It is reported that, according to this indicator, after a 10-day trial from downstream iron Xie to the mouth of the Lijin reach scouring of about 024.4 million tons. <br> comprehensive plans and arrangements for the good of the Yellow River water and sediment regulation test, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, through scientific control, the case does not affect cross-strait water the Xiaolangdi reservoir storage of 4.3 billion cubic meters, provide a reliable guarantee for the test. The scope of the test, including childhood Xiaolangdi reservoir to Shandong estuary more than 900 kilometers of river, establishment of fixed siltation quiz with 161 sections in more than nine hundred kilometers of the river. Shandong and Henan Provinces Close To this end all the Yellow River gate to avoid water loss; organization thousands dike workers good material substance, rescue and other preparatory work in order to cope with unexpected danger. Shandong has also demolished more than 40 on the river pontoon, to ensure that the water flow and the accuracy of the measurement data. <br>'
