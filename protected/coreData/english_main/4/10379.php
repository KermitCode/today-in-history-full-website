'cont'=>'November 4, 1998 (September 16) Tiger years, Lenovo Group swallowed Institute of Computing. <br> 1998, the Institute of Computing and Lenovo Group held a joint press forum, announced the reorganization rebuilt after the CAS Institute of Computing will be the Lenovo Group of the Academia Sinica. <br> Earlier, the Chinese Academy of Sciences in foreign introduce \"Knowledge Innovation Project\" 12 initiatives had mentioned calculated by Lenovo Group&#39;s \"close relationship\" caused an uproar, as it will be the tradition of the Academy of Sciences institutional reforms towards a significant impact, but to produce a vital role in the development of China&#39;s information industry. <br> association was only calculated by a three-the production <br> established in 1956, the calculation of the one of the ace of troops of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a well-known 103 and 104 computer, and the \"two bombs and one satellite \"Success God well done data processing work. The association, founded in 1984 (formerly calculated by the New Technology Development Corporation), just over 20 tertiary industry. the <br> original, Liu is 11 people with the calculation and the old director had Maochao give him $ 20 million start-up costs, resolutely out of the ivory tower. Lenovo Group has become the largest computer companies, sales leapt to the third Asia-Pacific last year&#39;s turnover of 12.5 billion yuan. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> 4 news conference, with the departure of successively two any calculation, director of Liu and Zeng Maochao, looked at each other and smiled. Liu told reporters: \"the original old director gives us $ 200,000, I am afraid it is not thought to have today. He just told me that the inside of funds, the state is to be weaned, make up a little life to the poverty of the scientific and technical personnel, the best choice to select the best time announced Lenovo cooperation with the calculation of the now, in the most the right time to do the things we want to do the most. \"Liu Chuanzhi says. <br> a few years ago, Lenovo Academia Sinica. But, like all the domestic research institutions, the outcome of a bunch, can not be transformed into reality. In 1995, Lenovo determined to dissolution of the Institute of the broken up added to the subsidiaries and division, just three years time, computer, QDI boards, systems integration and basically formed a product chain. [1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> \"to achieve the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, which is the most simple truth, everyone knows that. But why has not solve the key does not work, not suited to the internal management of the enterprise market. The pursuit of our business is not to maximize profits, but the cost is maximized, setting up shops have the right, good, but there is no profit no one cares. These issues can not be resolved, it can not be attached to the real high-tech market on Prof. Dr. will be laid off? The impetus for reform, the Chinese Academy of Sciences to change the calculation of the current study, chipping away, away from the market situation, solve less research funding and talent flow problems <br> CAS high-tech Secretary Gui Dr. Chuang said. The original calculation of the funding for research ranging from 20,000 yuan to more than 50,000 yuan, after the reform, through the support of the Association and the Academy of Sciences, to make a new calculation of the per capita funding for research to reach 20-40 million. <br> in order to improve efficiency, we must first streamlining administration. The calculation of the existing 1,400, reform after a split in two, new retaining only less than 100 people, also called the Institute of Computing, enter the calculation of the two others. <br> Guiju Zhang said on the way out of the people are generally concerned about the scientific and technical personnel, and accurate to say that the collective mobilization, because 1400 people, in addition to the retirement team of six or seven hundred people will enter two the vast majority have been in Computing dozen, of which only the association had 200 people. The two future is an independent cause of legal, responsible for the management of the originally calculated by the Office of the company and retirees. Academy of Sciences will be the original cause of the preparation, the capitation fee is sent to the two, said of the laid-off does not exist. <br> Guiju Zhang said, the Academy of the overall quality of the staff, everyone should be confident, scientific and technical personnel is a valuable asset of the state. Calculated by way out of the four: enter new by; into the association or other calculation the company; the administrative logistics socialization, access to Lenovo Technology Park; There is find another career. <br> basic research who is going to protect? still calculate the <br> newly established National Institute, soon to be appointed director of a double doctorate in both China and Japan, the chief scientist of the National 863 Program for Intelligent Computing theme Gawain. He said, will follow the principle of some things, the only issues that have a significant contribution to the development of the national economy, do not do free research. The new calculation by the strongest of the field of domestic R & D units, \"to provide for the development of the national information industry think tank, large domestic computer industry to provide technical library. \"<br> It is reported that the future of computing the research and development will be five hundred thirty-two settings: 50% for applied research, this part of the cooperation with Lenovo completed; 30% of the key technologies needed to complete the national; 20% of the basic research. New calculate the with Lenovo build Academia Sinica, the model combined with the industry. <br> out of the ivory tower or removed it <br> to calculate become Lenovo Academia Sinica, Chinese Academy of Sciences of the other how to do? Gui Zhuangju Zhang said, the reform of the scientific system of the country is still in the experimental stage, to Lenovo and calculated at the beginning, within the Academy of Sciences of the year will also start the project \"Knowledge Innovation Project\" launched 12. <br> Chinese Academy of Sciences established after the liberation to follow the Soviet model, made a great contribution to the history of the different periods of China&#39;s scientific development. But it is to adapt to the planned economic system, Guiju Zhang said, the current situation must be reform, the Academy of Sciences of the United States just a Fellow of service agencies, Germany and France also have very entity of the Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the way how to go in the future, no conclusion. <br>'
