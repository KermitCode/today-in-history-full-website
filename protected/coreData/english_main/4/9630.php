'cont'=>'October 4, 1947 (August 20), Chinese New Year, the death of the founder of quantum mechanics, Max Planck. <br> Planck&#39;s death \"target =\" _blank \"> the Planck <br> Max Planck (1858 -1947 on October 4, 2011), the German Physical scientist, the founder of quantum mechanics, one of the most important physicists of the twentieth century, the discovery of energy quanta of the progress of physics has made an important contribution, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. quantum mechanics development is considered to be the most important scientific developments of the 20th century, its importance can be comparable with Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity <br> Max Planck was born in Kiel on April 23, 1858, is the father second wife, mother, Emma, &#8203;&#8203;Pa Qixi (Emma Patzig born in 1821 -1914 years), he was baptized and given names are on the death of Karl Marx Planck \"target =\" _blank \"> Planck Ludwig, the name of its Ciming Marx, Max also adopt the name until his death. Planck another six siblings, four children [Hermann (Hermann), Hildegard (Hildegard), the Adal Beite (Adalbert) and Otto (Otto)] is the father born to the second wife of the father&#39;s first wife left two children, Hugo (Hugo) and Emma (Emma). Planck his childhood first few moments spent in Kiel, until 1867, the family moved to Munich, Planck was studying in Munich Maximilian Gymnasium (Maximiliansgymnasium), and there he was-math Oskar von Miller (Oskar von Miller) (who later became the founder of the Deutsches Museum) inspired, caused by the youth of the Max found himself interested in the mathematical. Miller also taught him astronomy and mechanics, and mathematics, learned her first-principle йд from Miller that Planck energy conservation. After Planck at the age of 16, completed secondary school, within the period of the school, (lssjt.cn) is Planck&#39;s first contact with the physics in this area. <br> Planck largest contribution in 1900 of a light quantum hypothesis. Light quantum hypothesis: In 1900, German physicist Max Planck discovered the law of the research object thermal radiation, only that the electromagnetic wave absorption and emission is not continuous, but a copy of the theoretical results to be consistent with the experimental fact that such an energy is called energy sub Planck also considered that each of the energy is equal to the HV, where V is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation, H is a constant = 6.63 * 10 -34 Squared naphthalene seconds , he was inspired by, in 1905, Einstein proposed that light propagation in space is not continuous, but a copy of each called a photon, referred to as the photon. <br> first, his hypothesis would undoubtedly be treated as an absurd thought abandoned aside. Although this hypothesis sounds bizarre, but in this particular case it is derived the correct formula. Most physicists (including the Planck myself) had considered this hypothesis, but to adapt to a very narrow mathematical assumptions. But a few years later showed that Planck&#39;s concept can be applied to many various physical phenomena outside than blackbody radiation. In 1905, Einstein used this concept to explain the photoelectric effect, 1913, Niels Bohr use this concept in his theory of atomic structure. 1918 Planck won the Nobel Prize. Basic right and his doctrine has a fundamental importance in the theory of physics. The development of quantum mechanics might be the most important scientific development in the 20th century, and even more important than Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. Planck&#39;s constant h plays an important role in the physical theory, is now considered to be one of the physical constants of the two or three most basic. <br>'
