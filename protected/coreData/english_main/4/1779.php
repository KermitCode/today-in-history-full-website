'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'March 4, 1923 (17 Guihai the first month), Hu Shi vigorously promote the study of Chinese culture. <br> 1923, \"reading magazines published the Hu articles a minimum Guoxue bibliography). Hu Shih said in the preamble: <br> this bibliography I promised Tsinghua School Hujun Dun-yuan, four people intend. Teenagers, they are going to go overseas to study in the common sense of the country so the school would like to have in a short period of time. So when I contemplated this bibliography is not Guoxue foundation in the vision, conceived only as an ordinary young people want to get the point system Guoxue knowledge. This is the first point I want to declare. <br> Although this is a bibliography, but also a Dharma. This the Famennian can be called the \"history of Chinese culture research method. The past four or five years, I received I do not know how many young friends ask the governing learn what avenue \"letter. Initially I had to learn the style of the older generation, to persuade people to start from the primary school, advising people to pass phonology exegetical first. But I recently repent! Kind words for the experts say, and say not for the beginner; scholars put up a front, if not the educator fascinating nothing. The phonological exegetical school it has not yet sorted out a clue system, how to start for beginner people work? More than 10 years of experience so I can not help but admit that the learning of phonological exegetical only can be used as a tool of \"scholars\", rather than \"beginner\" Path. Honestly doubtful today also no avenue can be said; those Guoxue achievements of the National People&#39;s Congress are under dead done stupid dry out. This avenue when I had to come up with a start: historical clues our natural systems continue to evolve with the natural order of the history of our country to learn. <br> This bibliography is in accordance with this concept. The order of this bibliography is the key to start. This is the second point I want to declare. <br>'
