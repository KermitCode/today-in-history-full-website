'cont'=>'October 4, 1998 (August 14) Tiger years, U.S. scientists revealed that clone their own plans. <br> 1998 10 4, (history com) a plan to clone themselves and attempt to prove that genetic engineering can be a good thing for American scientists Richard said Sid, he hoped Each year, 500 clone was born. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> Harvard biologist Richard Xideboshi, pointed out that any attempt to stop scientific progress are futile. People should see the advantages of cloning, and should not be worried about its negative impact. (History www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> Sid said: \"Parliament can not prevent the (human cloning). The development of cloning technology is inevitable, and will not slow down its pace of development. We have the ability to do this, we will continue to clone, the fight for a year to manufacture the 100, 200 or even 500 clone. \"<br> Sidr view has led to fears of some other scientists. This is the first time in a program broadcast by the British television Channel 5 that night, he comprehensively expounded their point of view. (Lsjt.org) <br> medical studies at the University of Cambridge scientists, gene technology Visiting Lecturer Patrick Dixon is also this show appearances. He said that people should \"clearly\" see the threat posed by the Xideboshi, and should recognize that human cloning work is already in progress, and probably will go on. <br> Dixon said: \"People still think that this kind of thing is still in the science fiction stage. But the fact is that human cloning is perfectly legal in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, despite the fact that is likely to make some members of the British Parliament was shocked, because they feel that they had in 1991 the ban on human cloning. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> Dr. Dixon, scattered around the world, some scientists have cloned, but so far no one knows what they are doing. <br> Dixon said, shortly before he had talked about the matter with a British scientist. The scientist said that he intends to manufacture two identical, one frozen for another person to provide the various spare organs of the body. Dixon refused to disclose the name of the scientist who. <br> Dixon added, 1993, Washington, a scientist cloned several human embryos, but he threw away after the completion of the experiment, he gave cloned embryos. <br> Dr. Dixon said: \"The scientists engaged in this type of experiment can always be kept strictly confidential. The cloning of Dolly the sheep used in the experimental stage strictly secret up to several years. <br> Xideboshi said: \"The public believe that human cloning had a bad name.\" I want to emphasize is that this view is not correct. Human cloning is also a cute little thing, looks no different with the other children, not a Frankenstein monster created. Part of my job is to let people know that human cloning is only infertile couples have a child of another method. It is just another advanced technology of human reproduction. \"<br> To prove human cloning harmless aged 69 Xideboshi is to clone themselves. , His body a cell nucleus and egg donors combined, then fertilized embryos implanted in the womb of his wife, Gloria. <br> However, Dr. Dixon pointed out that, before the implications of not yet fully believe that cloning should stop all further cloning experiments worldwide. <br>'
