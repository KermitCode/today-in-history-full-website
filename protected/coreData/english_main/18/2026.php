'cont'=>'February 18, 1838 (24) Reform Movement of the first month, the Austrian physicist, speed quantifier \"Mach\" named Mach was born. Ernst Mach, <br> \"named by Mach was born\" target = \"_blank\"> Mach (Ernst Mach), 1838 to 1916, Austrian ¡¤ Czech physicist, philosopher and biological scientist, born on February 18, 1838 Kier Stiglitz. The father is a tutor. Childhood good causal relationship with auditory, tactile observe things, junior high school, he is not interested in the church school curriculum is deemed not suitable for research and learning, the children of the poor performance in the natural charm. Father&#39;s collection of books became a treasure trove he taught himself. Studied mathematics, physics and philosophy, graduating in 1860, and received his Ph.D. at the University of Vienna. She served from 1864 to 1867 at the University of Graz, the mathematical professor and professor of experimental physics, 1867 to 1895, professor of physics at the University of Prague in any experiment, and twice was elected Chancellor. Retired in 1901, but still continue to engage in scientific writing. February 19, 1916 in Germany medias &#174; interchange This function determines appropriate Teng&#39;s death. <br> Mach life dedicated to the study of experimental physics and philosophy. Published more than 100 research papers and reports on the mechanical, acoustic and optical. His high-speed movement of objects in the gas, and found that the shock wave. Supersonic motion to determine the physical speed and the ratio of the speed of sound (Mach number) as standard, to describe the object. Mach effect, Mahe Bo, Mach angle Mach named terminology is widely used in aerodynamics, Mach on the mechanics of the historic contribution. He first instrument demo acoustic Doppler effect, the n-dimensional atomic theory. <br> Mach is a theoretical physicist with a critical spirit. His analysis of the history of science investigation and scientific methodology and author of several rich in, epistemology color and experienced point of view of the book of history, mechanics and its development in 1883 critical historical Introduction \"(referred to as\" the history of mechanics assessment ) greatest impact this work has had a profound influence on the development of physics. Absolute time of Newton in the book, the critique of absolute space and inertia understanding, establishing general relativity of Einstein played an active role and become the basis of the latter write a gravitational field equation. Later Einstein to his thinking is called Mach&#39;s principle. Mach scientific epistemology had strong repercussions in the natural scientists, scientists influenced by the most famous Einstein and Bridgman and quantum mechanics Copenhagen school some physicists. [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] <br> Mach also wrote reprinted 20 times using a 40-year college students in physics tutorial \"(1891) and\" Students&#39; low-grade natural science textbooks (1886), is well-known in physics education house. <br> Mach philosophy is the logical positivist idealism. He denied that the gas dynamic theory of atoms, molecules real sacrifice. In this regard, the Boltzmann had sharp criticism. Lenin in his book \"Materialism and experience criticism the critical Mach&#39;s idealism perspective. <br>'
