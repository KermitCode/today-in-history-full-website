'cont'=>'October 18, 1989, September 19 (Baba), the United States launched the Galileo Jupiter spacecraft. <br> 1989 10, 18, twice delayed the launch of space shuttle \"Atlantis\", and finally in the afternoon 12 53 in Cape Canaveral, Florida, roared rushed sky. \"Atlantis\" The main task of the space trip is to explore Jupiter&#39;s Galileo spacecraft into Earth orbit. <br> 7:13 that night, \"Atlantis\" has been successfully released the Galileo spacecraft and its propeller. At this point, the Galileo spacecraft has set foot for six years, a trip of about 3.8 billion kilometers long journey flying to Jupiter. Flew to Jupiter in December 1995, an automatic detector out of the spacecraft, fall into Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere.

The spacecraft is equipped with cameras, near-infrared survey spectrometer, magnetometer instrument, the cloud measuring instrument, the atmospheric structure instrument, such as 17 kinds of scientific instruments for Jupiter&#39;s atmosphere constitutes the clouds structure, temperature, magnetic field and other aspects of the investigation and research. <br> the Galileo Jupiter probe plans by the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany joint. <br>'
