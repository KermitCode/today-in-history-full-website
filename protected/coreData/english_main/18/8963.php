'cont'=>'September 18, 2009 (Year of the OX July 30),&#39;s first density close to the Earth planet found outside the solar system. COROT-7b concept map of <br> <br> planet <br> According to the United States, \"Connection\" magazine website reported, in the vastness of the universe, astronomers have never efforts to stop looking for extrasolar Earth-like planets. September 18, 2009, astronomers have finally obtained conclusive evidence, they successfully measured the quality of the extrasolar planet found its density and the Earth close. The scientists confirmed the first one with the Earth density close to the Earth-like planets. MIT researchers <br> American Sarah - Siegel said: \"This is a long time dream day. \"Although not involved in the study, but Sarah - Siegel or the significance of the study give a higher rating,\" This is the first confirmed extrasolar rocky planet, which is in the field opens a new door. We are really very excited. (Lssdjt.com) \"<br> In fact, as early as February this year, astronomers discovered planets COROT-7b, but was unable to determine its quality. Later, scientists with the \"high-precision radial velocity planet searcher\" (HARPS) spectrograph up to 70 hours of observation data, scientists from the European Southern Observatory (European Southern Observatory) calculate the planet&#39;s mass is only more than five times the Earth&#39;s. According to the diameter of the planet known, its diameter is about twice that of the Earth, the scientists calculated the density of the planet, and finally come to the conclusion that this is close to the first one and the Earth&#39;s density extrasolar terrestrial planets. whether there is similar to the planet and the Earth the <br> universe? our planet is unique in the universe pride of it? This is a very profound question. So far, no one to give a positive or negative answer. In fact, so far the scientists have found that about 12 smaller Earth-like planets, and in the process discovered planets COROT-7b, the astronomers also found that it&#39;s a sister planet, called COROT-7c planet. In addition, the astronomers have found a certain similarity to Earth&#39;s surface by the rocky planets in the Milky Way. But their quality is far more than the Earth, but also the lack of a planet around sun-like rotating, but rotation around the stars have died. However, most of the planets are giant gas planet, such as the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn. Gas planets may not be a solid surface, while the main component is hydrogen, helium and the presence of different physical states under water. not limited to efforts <br> astronomers find Earth-like planets, and would like to explore whether the survival of Earth-like planets suitable for extraterrestrial life exists. Siegel says that human beings are most likely to close in one and the Earth&#39;s density smaller rocky planets discovered extraterrestrial life. She said: \"exoplanet research can even say that the holy grail of scientific research is to discover Earth-like planets, to find signs of life on Earth-like planet. \"<br> COROT-7b planet density and closer proximity to Earth, but also rocky planets, but the planets temperatures up to 2000 degrees Celsius during the day, at night the temperature dropped to minus 200 degrees Celsius, scientists believe that COROT-7b The environment of the planet is too cruel life. In addition to being the first one was confirmed and the Earth density close to the rocky terrestrial planets, COROT-7b planet than any other known planet from its primary star. COROT-7b planet around its primary star to a record of 750,000 kilometers per hour speed revolution. Scientists speculate that the planet&#39;s environment is very harsh, the surface magma spewing, or boiling oceans. Because it is the first one and the Earth&#39;s density close to the Earth-like planets discovered outside the solar system, scientists do not know bears no secret on the planet, pending further study found. the <br> Before last week, scientists announced the quality of COROT-7b, an astronomer at the University of California Greg expressed the feeling of excitement. He said: \"We do not know how to define a planet is the mass of the Earth five times. You can say that it is a queen of the earth, it can be said that the super-Earths. Or said small Neptune, Uranus. It was never before been able to see the basic planetary type. The \"<br> Comments: I hope an early human in outer space to find the biological species. <br>'
