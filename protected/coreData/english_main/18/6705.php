'cont'=>'July 18, 1998 (May 25) Tiger years leap, experts estimated that the drying up of the Yellow River in 2020 downstream throughout the year. <br> 2020, the lower reaches of the Yellow River is drying up all year. This is a water expert at July 18, 1998 at the 1998 International Year of the Ocean \"Love Me Blue Land\" Ocean Awareness Day Conference on view. Yellow River dry situation intensified in recent years. The drying up of the Yellow River began in the early 1970s, the 25-year period since 1970, the Yellow River has interrupters 18; shut-off six times in the 1970s, an average of seven days of drying up, drying up river is 130 km long; 1980s interrupters 7 times the average drying up to 7.4 days, drying up river is 150 km long; drying up five times in six years in the 1990s, an average of 53 days of drying up, drying up river length of 300 km. In 1995 the river failed to reach 122 days, the interrupter reach up to 683 km. According to the relevant departments to provide the data in 1996, the Yellow River drying up 136 days, drying up river 579 km; 1997 Yellow River drying up 226 days, the interrupter reach 700 km. According to preliminary calculations, the Yellow River has been drying up to 118 days, drying up river about 480 km. The same projections, 2000, the Yellow River will be drying up 140 days; 2010 Yellow River drying up 200 days; 2020, the lower reaches of the Yellow River drying up all year. Experts predict that, the Yellow River has become a foregone conclusion in an inland river, the Yellow River dry not only for the region&#39;s sustainable development and people&#39;s living adverse impact, and will have far-reaching ecological problems, such as: the Yellow River falling water tables, dry climate, land of drought, biodiversity loss, erosion by the sea water along the estuary of the Yellow River, the Yellow River in the desertification impact spillway. <br>'
