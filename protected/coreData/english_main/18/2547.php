Mongolians interested in the nature of territorial expansion, also passed by Yelena Ivan IV. In 1533, Vasily III dead Testament by Yelena with seven large aristocratic regency meeting, affairs of state agents before Ivan IV adult. But Yelena quickly is incompatible with many great nobles, she abolished the regency meeting arrogate all powers and beaten to death two brothers Vasily III. In 1538, Yelena sudden death, reportedly for political opponents of the poison, this year, Ivan IV just 8 years old. Ivan IV childhood shows the the bloodthirsty side enjoys torturing small animals and looked cruel death. Its protection of people in the age of 13, and Shuyi Sharansky let dog bites dead. <br> Yelena after the death of her brother Green the Chomsky defeated political opponents continue to control the affairs of state. In 1547, Ivan the official coronation. The same year, Green Sharansky in a big fire caused by popular uprisings were killed, Ivan IV officially embarked on the front desk, to rule the country with his unique way. <br> should be said that, in 1560, his rule fairly smooth and fruitful track running. The aid of of Ada Jeff Sylvester, he promulgated a new code of laws, the restructuring of the administrative agencies, the reform of the military system, strengthen the military forces conquered the eastern side of the Kazan Khanate, Astra rare Khanate, and forced the Siberian Khanate surrender the. In 1560 after the death of his first wife, Anastasia, his mind more and more unusual, most historians believe that he had syphilis, syphilis into advanced, it will make the patients suffering from mental disorder. winter <br> 1564, Ivan IV suddenly portability family left Moscow, came to Alexandria Grove Village, near the capital, and people messenger came back: \"I no longer manage the treachery around me can not be tolerated, in this country, but by God&#39;s guidance Road to go. His behavior in Moscow caused a panic after the archbishop of his \"right to execute anyone want to put to death the traitor promise, he returned to Moscow. <br> Subsequently, he introduced the country to his original \"special rule over the national territory is divided into two parts, a special area, owned by the direct management of the Czar, a common area, mainly for remote and backward areas. normalized the aristocratic lords management, many great nobles from special districts rushed to the common area, greatly weakened the strength. Ivan the Terrible at the same time set up a Czar absolute loyal subjects cold and imperious special military jurisdiction. Subsequently, a field of the massacre began, during the years 1565-1572 to implement special dominion peak. The main targets of the massacre have the strength to resist the the Tsarist feudal princes and great nobles. In seven years, about the killing of more than 4,000 nobility. Ivan IV in the eradication of the great nobles, to foster a small aristocracy and the power of the people, and special dominion over the positive role is to eliminate the local lords separatist hidden, strengthened centralization, which may be experienced in the development of Russian history step, adopted too intense. <br> Ivan IV Vasilyevich Abramovich <br> some of Ivan the Terrible tyranny is the tyranny of despots only to explain. His army ransacked Novgorod has been independent and republican tendencies, it is estimated that thousands of people confronted by danger, the annexation of the Kazan Khanate of Kazan People&#39;s massacre. Finally, in 1581, Ivan IV in rage accidentally killed the heir Ivan Prince Edward and his massacre irreparable guilt finally come to an end. <br> Ivan IV in territorial expansion useful as he has annexed the Kazan Khanate (1552), the Astrakhan Khanate (1556) and the Siberian Khanate (1579), also defeating the Crimean Khanate, the territory east of Russia sharply forward, the Mongols were no longer to be a threat. In some of the battle, he personally pitched brave battle, and made a \"continuous fight against the enemy\" and \"in the field in order to destroy the enemy&#39;s effective strength as a starting point\" strategy. In addition, he annexed large Nogai Khanate and 匙妦價嫌捚 the North Caucasus, many ethnic allegiance Russia.

Ivan IV (l $ j而.c里) <br> internal affairs strategy, in addition to the above eradicate the great nobles, to foster small and medium-sized nobles, strengthen the centralization, there is an important point, is to reiterate Ivan III About farmers must leave Yuri section to provisions of the landlord, and enrich some of the terms. Stuck in the quagmire of serfdom in Russia to step forward. During the reign of Ivan IV, the \"czar\" has become the official title of the monarch of Russia (the title comes from the Russians call the Byzantine monarch, Ivan III has been used in this title, but not yet fixed). <br> cultural level is high, Ivan IV, has been actively promoted in Russia printing. He is an excellent orator. <br> select from the process point of view of Russian history, from the title of tsar, to the direction of expansion, to the internal affairs policy, army building, Ivan IV has obvious followed the traces of Ivan III, in this sense, Ivan IV history under Ivan III. But on the other hand, Ivan IV brutal suppression of the great nobles, to foster small aristocratic strengthen monarchical Russia took to strengthen the centralization in line with the historical trend of consolidation of the nation-state of the roads, that go beyond Ivan III. Ivan IV column names in important imperial column 89 in the rankings. <br> Review: Ivan IV era just achieved independence and unity of Russia, there are two options, one loose nobility autonomy country, the state power centralization. Moscow in the long struggle to form the traditional and Mongols left my ambitions Ivan IV, the latter has become the inevitable choice. The tyranny of Ivan IV basically can be explained by the need to maintain unity and centralized, which makes brutal Ivan IV, is still considered to be a generation of outstanding Czar. <br>'
