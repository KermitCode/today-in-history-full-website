The Liu Shaoqi Then socialist when engaged in only to see the actual situation in order to answer the question. After 10 years, you can take some socialist steps; also possible after 10 years, still can not take this step, we have to wait a few years. Liu Shaoqi also criticized the kind of thought 10, 8, 30, 20 farmers to organize themselves, land, livestock, farm implements common use by the primary form of agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid teams can go directly China&#39;s agricultural socialist idea, pointing out that this is a socialist agricultural utopia. Workers stage help and leadership, the farmers themselves can not engage in socialism, it is impossible to rely solely on the power of the farmers to the socialist. If you think that the so called socialism, and called on farmers together to organize agricultural cooperatives to launch a mass movement, it is necessary to have committed a big mistake. <br>'
