'cont'=>'(Bingyin April the tenth), May 18, 1986, death of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Chi Yu Feng. death of <br> discipline education Symphony \"target =\" _blank \"> discipline education ãã, Born in Zhejiang yinxian, December 22nd, 1899, graduated in 1922 from the University of Shanghai, Department of Chemistry, (Lssdjt.com) then went to the United States into the Chicago University study, 1923 received a master&#39;s degree after returning to teach in Wuchang Normal University, Department of Chemistry, 1926, once again the United States, organic chemistry at Yale University the home Johnson (TBJohnson) under the guidance of the professor, PhD, in 1928, the school philosophy doctorate after returning home, his doctoral thesis the pyrimidine compounds structure determination. the \"after returning <br> century education Symphony, has in a number of schools and research institutions engaged in teaching and research work. successive Northeastern University (1928 -1930), Xiamen University (1930), (lssdjt.cn) Zhejiang University (1930-1933), Guangxi University (1936-1939), Shanghai Medical College, Kunming, Southwest Union University (1939-1943), professor on campus. \" Central Institute of Chemical Research Institute (1934-1936), researcher at the Peking Institute of Drug Research Institute (1943-1949) after the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, served as the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1949-1951) Research Fellow, Department of the Central Institutes of Health drugs ( The predecessor of the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 1952 - 1958) the Fellow and synthetic director, Fellow and Deputy Director of Beijing Institute of Chemical Reagent Plant (1958-1982), \"Chemistry\" and \"Pharmaceutical Journal editorial board and other staff. (l $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) 1955 was elected academician of the Division of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Academician) of <br> century education Symphony research work, including a class of heterocyclic compounds of the pyrimidine, thiazole, quinoline the herbal chemical composition, vitamin B1 fully synthetic antimalarial, anti-schistosomiasis drug, Determination of vitamin C in animal and plant products distribution. <br> century education Symphony choose shrink synthetic pyrimidine ring, a lot of work with experiment confirmed the direction of the reduced synthesis of the pyrimidine ring, acetyl acetone, benzoyl acetone, and the annular of ¦Â-cyclohexyl ketone, respectively, with different aldehydes and urea in a condensation reaction in the role of catalyst. also studied a variety of the halogenated pyrimidine synthesis and reaction performance. conversion reaction of halogenated pyrimidine found in different types of substituted pyrimidine synthesis method. mercaptopyrimidine synthesis and reaction performance, he proposed without ammonia that can chlorine generation of the pyrimidine biosynthesis aminopyrimidine new method, also without thio hydrogen by the halogenated pyrimidine preparation Mercaptopyrimidine. <br> century education Symphony&#39;s early in the Reye Germany Institute of Medical Research, Academia Sinica and Guangxi University, told the Chinese herbal medicine were series of studies has basil, iris, Peucedanum, Bupleurum, large tooth Duhuo, big flower Epimedium, mother of pearl, Oncorhynchus, and tobacco, and other classic method is the separation and identification of the chemical composition, from independent living isolated several crystalline flavonoid glycosides isolated from Epimedium is a chemical method for the first time the results of the study of Chinese herbs in China. <br> century education Symphony has developed a simple and accurate new method for determination of vitamin C content, 120 kinds of edible plants and animal products and Chinese medicines Determination of vitamin C content was used to provide a lot of valuable data for our nutrition and physiology. <br> century education Symphony is a patriotic scientists after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Shanghai fall, Japanese Puppet hired his tenure, he steadfastly refused to overcome difficulties and resistance and moved to Chongqing to continue to coach at the Shanghai Medical College, moved to the mainland, and served as the director of the Pharmaceutical He not only teaches organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and physics chemistry course, crude chemical plant waste to extract the chemical reagents used for research and teaching work during the Beijing Institute of Chemical Reagents, <br> century education Symphony, the the chemical reagents developed planning, especially pyrimidine and purine nucleic acid bases, ribose, as well as the development of more than 20 kinds of basic amino acids visionary, has contributed to the development of China&#39;s chemical reagents. <br> century education Symphony upright, strong character, life tirelessly pursue scientific careers. lives very frugal, but at the cost of big money buying Bear Stearns Organic Chemistry Daquan \", the\" chemical literature \"and\" American Chemical Society Soc world-famous scientific publications cherished collections who his research work related to the important new book, as far as possible try to buy, it is a lifetime collection of books quite good. 1983, he passed away the first anniversary of the occasion, his wife Yang group of Chinese compliance with his wishes, to his lifetime collection of all science and technology books and more than 3,000 volumes of sub- donated Xinjiang Branch of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Institute of Chemical Reagents, make a final contribution to support the cause of frontier science and development of chemical reagents. <br>'
