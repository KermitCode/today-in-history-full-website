'cont'=>'November 18, 1983 October 14 (Guihai years), China strongly protested the resolution of the future of Taiwan in the United States. <br> 1983 11 18, Zhu Zhen, China&#39;s Assistant Foreign Minister summoned U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hummel November 15, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a so-called resolution of the issue on the future of Taiwan \" on behalf of the Chinese government lodged a strong protest to the U.S. government, and he handed a note of protest: on November 15 <br>, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a so-called resolution on the future of Taiwan. The case claimed: \"the future of Taiwan should be resolved peace, without coercion; in a manner acceptable to the people of Taiwan, and Congress passed the communique reached between the legal and the United States and the People&#39;s Republic of China. \"This action of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is a deliberate violation of China&#39;s sovereignty and flagrant interference in China&#39;s internal affairs, aroused great indignation of the Chinese people. In response, the Chinese government to raise a strong protest to the U.S. government. <br> early as March 1983, the Chinese government on the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States put forward the so-called \"Taiwan&#39;s Future\" proposal things too solemn representations among US relations just improved, eight months later, when, The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee turned rethrow the case, and through them. This can not but wonder that the U.S. government to How&#39;s attitude to improve Sino-US relations. <br> that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. How to resolve the Taiwan question and achieving national reunification is China&#39;s internal, no foreign interference. Improper comments of the future of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the part of the Chinese territory, even by the so-called resolution, which is a wanton violation of the norms governing international relations, is hegemony performance. The essence of the resolution is the name of the people of the so-called Taiwan&#39;s \"self-determination\" under the banner of a vain attempt to permanently split Taiwan from China. This with the previous communiques between China and the United States affirmed the principle is fundamentally incompatible. The resolution said the resolution of the Taiwan issue to comply with the laws passed by the U.S. Congress, and that is to meet a serious breach of the principles of the Sino-US Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations and the Taiwan Relations Act \". This is extremely absurd. Only give relations between the two countries to set up new barriers to greater damage to Sino-US relations. <br> Chinese government strongly urge the U.S. government to take immediate and effective measures to prevent the further developments.
