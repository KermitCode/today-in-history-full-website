'title'=>'The birth of the Dutch theoretical physicist Lorentz',
'class'=>4,
'cont'=>'July 18, 1853 (on June 13 Guichou), Dutch theoretical physicist Lorentz was born. <br> 1853 July 18, 2010, Lorenz was born in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Had studied at Leiden University, and received his Ph.D. in 1875. In 1877, he was only 24 years old and became a professor of theoretical physics in Leiden. Lorenz was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Lorentz widespread interest in physics and mathematics. <br> His early work from the writings of Hermann von Helmholtz , and began his doctorate thesis. Lorentz finishing Maxwell&#39;s theory, for the first time include light reflection and refraction (bending), including a variety of effects can be fully explained. <br> 1892 to 1904 years Lorentz published a series of papers, the central idea of &#8203;&#8203;the paper is to propose a \"theory of electrons\" He proposed that the atoms and molecules of the substance contains the Xiaogang bodies carry a positive or negative charge, each Xiaogang body 18 Mao He these charged particles as the \"E\". been explained by the effects of these electrons, Science many phenomena. Lorentz believe that the substance and the carrier medium is referred to as \"Ether\" different entities electronic interaction between them as a medium he believes that the interaction of light waves with matter from the presence of electrons in matter, Maxwell&#39;s equations predicted that light waves will be generated if these charged particles vibration. <br> 1895 Lorentz describes the substance in the force of the charged particles in the electromagnetic field, and is now known as the Lorentz force. 1900 he has been found constituting the cathode rays with a negatively charged particle is recognized as a negative electron his theory. Loran HEREBY GIVEN that due to the study of the influence of the magnetic field of the radiation and Peter Zeeman received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics. <br> electron theory, however, can not be explained as other phenomena as the photoelectric effect, the fact that these phenomena with Los the Lenz theory of incompatible, these exceptions to stimulate the development of quantum theory. <br> Lorentz famous work is his proposed solution in the 1880s, Albert Michelson and Edward ¡¤ ; Morley Earth passes through the issues raised by the motion through the ether experiments. This solution also independently by George Fitzgerald presented before the so called Lorentz Fitzgerald contraction. (Lssdjt.com) Lorentz expand his concept and this concept on a more solid mathematical foundation, published in 1904, called the final form of the Lorentz transformation. including part of the theory laid Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity. February 4, 2011 <br> 1928, Lorenz died in Haarlem, the Netherlands. <br>'
