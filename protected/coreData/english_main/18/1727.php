He canceled a possible marriage of the daughter, was the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (Mary&#39;s cousin) and wealthy French King Francois (of course Mary&#39;s cousin). In addition, she had fallen into a palace nanny, to wait on her sister Princess Elizabeth - Anne Boleyn&#39;s daughter from the 17-year-old.
