'cont'=>'(Seeing in June, the fifth day), July 18, 1635, born in England physicists Hooker. <br> <br> Robert Hooke (Robert Hooke ,1635.7.18-1703 .3.3) was born in the Isle of Wight, southern England on July 18, 1635 (July 18) the Lunar The ¸¥À×Ê©ÍßÌØ. The father was the local vicar. Hooke small frail personality quirks but ingenuity, passion for tinkering with machines, homemade wooden clock, can small warships fired. Year-old, Hooker mechanics occurred a strong interest in, and has laid a good foundation for the future development in experimental physics. In 1648, Hooker&#39;s father passed away, and come down. 13-year-old hooker was sent to London a painting Carpenter home as an apprentice, and later as the lead singer of the church choir, when too rich to be from. Westminster school principals enthusiastic help, Hooker completing the secondary school curriculum. Hooker Creole Institute at Oxford University in 1653 as a work-study students to learn. Here, he met some very talented scientific circles. Those people most of whom became the backbone of the Royal Society. Hook eager to participate in the group of doctors and scholars and unique experiment to reveal. 1655 Huke Cheng Oxford University Willis (1621-1675, British physician, brain and neurology experts) assistant, was also recommended to Boyle&#39;s laboratory work. Due to his experiments to 1662, was appointed to the Royal Society of Experimental host, arrange three or four experiments for each party received a master&#39;s degree in 1663, the same year was elected to the Royal Society, full member, he was also an adjunct Society showroom administrators and librarians.

He studied cover a very wide range, such as construction, fossils, meteorology, he has studied under and contributions. Literacy but as a scientist, Hooker also a lack of skilled and strong mathematical and logical reasoning skill as weapons research and thinking, so that is not easy from the combination of theory and practice, a thorough analysis and problem-solving. This is Hooke and Newton, Huygens inferior place. <br> Review: Hook is one of Britain&#39;s most eminent scientists of the 17th century.
