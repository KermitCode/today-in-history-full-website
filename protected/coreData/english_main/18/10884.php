'cont'=>'November 18, 1962 (October 22) Renyin, contribute to the atomic bomb Bohr died. <br> Niels Henrik David Bohr (Niels Henrik David Bohr, 1885.10.07 ~ 1962.11.18) <br> Niels Henrik David Bohr, born on October 7, 1885 in Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of the first-class scientists in the 20th century. He first application of the quantum theory the upcoming energy of a system is limited to certain discrete values &#8203;&#8203;to study the atomic structure and molecular structure of the problem. In the process of the development of quantum physics, he was the dominant figure, also made a major contribution. the <br> 1930 onwards, Bohr continue to engage in the epistemological problems caused by the quantum theory, also contributed to this new field of nuclear physics. He nuclei compared to a droplet, droplets concept to understand many of the key means of nuclear processes, 1939, in the understanding of nuclear fission (a heavy nuclear fission into two nearly equal mass of two parts, releasing huge amounts of energy The) real plays an important role. <br> 1940 Danish German devastation and occupation, in the face of Nazi power, Bohr endeavor to safeguard the work of the Institute and to maintain the integrity of the Danish culture. In 1943, because of his Jewish ancestry and never hidden anti-Nazi point of view, he was subject to the threat of immediate arrest. Bohr and his wife, his family, by the Danish underground resistance movement (organization) night fishing boats sent to Sweden. A few days later, the British government sent an unarmed Mosquito bombers for the machine to Sweden, Bohr so &#8203;&#8203;dramatic flight to fly to the United Kingdom, he almost died in flight. Over the next two years, Bohr and his son Aage join the fission bomb project. Auger after his father&#39;s footsteps, is a theoretical physicist, chaired the Institute of Theoretical Physics, won the Nobel Prize in Physics. They worked for several months in the United Kingdom, and British research group moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico research center. <br> Bohr particularly concerned about the terrible threat of atomic weapons on humans. Back in 1944, he tried to persuade British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to solve these problems through international cooperation. While this appeal was not successful, Bohr in 1950 to continue the efforts made by the United Nations in an open letter in an \"open world and reasonable peace policy\". Bohr believed that in order to control the nuclear weapons, the people and their ideas must be free exchange. He led to promote the First International Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Conference 1955 in Geneva, and to assist in the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research Commission (CERN). He received many accolades, Bohr was in 1957 and the First Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Prize. <br> in his later years, Bohr tried to point out, may indicate that some of the problems in many aspects of human life and thought, the idea of &#8203;&#8203;complementary. Generations of physicists will have a significant impact on their scientific ideas and perspectives of life plays a guiding role of the Enlightenment. Bohr continuously to all aspects of learning, even the youngest working together also holding the attitude of listening to learn. He and his colleagues, his wife, son and brother relations are good, he gained strength from them. His spirit wealthy international, but he is also full of Danes, he is deeply rooted in his Danish culture. This can be seen in many public affairs from his responsibility, especially from 1939 onwards, he is the president of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences, has been responsible for the end of life. <br> Bohr couple <br>'
