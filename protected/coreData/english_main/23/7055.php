'class'=>4,
'cont'=>'July 23, 2001, three days of June (Government House), was born less than perfect Bonn agreement. Bonn climate meeting <br> attention of world public opinion, in the edge of the brink of failure after tough negotiations and transactions, as well as numerous on July 23, 2001, was finally reached for a compromise acceptable to all parties. Although this result than determined by the 1997 Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas reduction targets and took a step back, but finally at the last minute to avoid defeat, thus still largely welcomed by the international community, \"the Kyoto Protocol\" finally \" saved. Belgian Energy Minister Druze, said: \"a surviving less than perfect agreement, after all, is better than perfect agreement does not exist. \"However, many environmental organizations Bonn agreement strongly criticized that the Kyoto protocol is compromised. <br> Bonn meeting is the sixth meeting of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Protection. In 2000, the Hague Conference failed, after the United States announced its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, States Parties for 1997 to determine the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the world from 2008 to 2012 than in 1990 decreased by 5.2% target can not be achieved, climate protection will not abortion and other issues, the international community is very concerned about. In accordance with the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, the agreement must include the industrial countries is currently 55% of the emissions, and the approval of the 55 States Parties to take effect. As a U.S. emissions accounted for 1/4 of the world&#39;s total, its exit will form the other industrial countries, (1 $ dj而.c身m), in particular the so-called \"Umbrella Group\" in Japan, Canada, Australia and Russia&#39;s pressure. If in any one country, especially the largest emitters of Japan following the United States, the target can not be achieved. There are indications that these countries really want to move out of the United States as an excuse to beat a retreat. Before the meeting, Japan has an ambiguous attitude to become common knowledge. (L $ dj而.c身m) German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had pre personally phoned Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, to urge him not to because Japan caused by the Bonn meeting failed. <br> However, precisely because of the withdrawal of the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Russia and the hands to increase the bargaining chips. Bonn conference negotiations mainly focused on two aspects: First, the role of forests and eco-agricultural land for carbon dioxide absorption Can included in the emission reduction targets; whether the above-mentioned countries through environmental protection investment in Third World countries to buy emission reduction targets and other workarounds to reduce their own emissions reduction fixed target. These two issues are also the focus of controversy last year, the Hague Conference. The first question on the forefront of the European Union has firmly rejected the forest storage of greenhouse gases, the United States, Japan, Canada, the three countries as an excuse to attempt to evade the obligation;, the EU favors the boundaries to be set to work on the second question. (Lssdjt.com) <br> in order to strive for the success of the Bonn conference, Japan, Canada and other countries \"pull board\" abandoned the original position at the negotiation process, the EU agreed to the forest into the emission reduction targets calculations. In this case, Japan and other countries has finally made a number of emission reduction commitments, which opened the way to reach the 55 countries have ratified the boundaries. [TodayinHistory.cn defects of <br> Bonn conference has two aspects. First, many environmental organizations have criticized the discount rate is too too much emission reduction becomes a \"gesture\". According to the calculations, in accordance with the result of the compromise, 2008-2012, of the world&#39;s greenhouse gas emission reductions only 1.8% rather than 5.2% of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol \". Second, this meeting is not on supervision and punishment mechanism to reach agreement. Japan, Canada and other countries are opposed to the EU advocated the establishment of such a mechanism, obviously its doing everything possible to try to evade the obligations stand the same strain. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> declared that the \"Kyoto Protocol\" useless \",\" error \", the United States also attended the meeting. The person in charge of the U.S. delegation uphold the denial of the \"Kyoto Protocol\" side to side and aggressive, related to the interests of the United States, it is necessary to intervention. Criticism and ridicule of the unreasonable attitude of the United States by many groups both inside and outside the venue, it is very isolated. (History the cn Bonn) <br>, meeting a compelling place, the opposition in the United States, does not participate in the case, the vast majority of the 178 countries to reach a compromise on a global problem. prominent international political significance. The \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", the editorial said, not the United States, the only superpower participation to reach an agreement, which is not an insignificant fringe phenomenon. The Berlin Daily editorial pointed out that the international community for the first time shows, sometimes American things went well. Information issued by the Bonn meeting, the international community, especially the EU show the courage, to prove their autonomy. EU should not only be on the climate issue, but also in practical politics should display its leading role in the new diplomatic arena. <br>'
