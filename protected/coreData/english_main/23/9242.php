'cont'=>'(Renyin August 22), September 23, 1902, the outstanding Chinese mathematician Su Buqing born. <br> Su Buqing (1902.9.23-2003.3.17), formerly known as Su Shanglong. Pingyang County, Zhejiang. Famous mathematician. After graduating from high school in 1919, went to study in Japan. Japan Tohoku Imperial University in 1927, graduated from the Department of Mathematics, into the school after the Graduate School, graduated Ph.D. in 1931. March 1931 should be famous mathematician Chen Jiangong about returning ScD honor of carrying the Tohoku Imperial University in Japan, employed at the National Institute of Zhejiang University, she served as the number of Associate Professor, Department of professor, dean, dean of students and dean. During this period, together with Chen Jiangong founded the \"differential geometry faction\". October 1952, due to the adjustment of the National College, came to, he was Professor of Mathematics, Fudan University, Head of the Department, he served as Fudan University provost, vice principals and principals. Former Chinese Academy of Sciences academician, multi-session of the CPPCC National Committee, the National People&#39;s Congress, the fifth, the sixth member of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, seventh, eighth vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference and the NLD vice chairman of the Central Committee and other staff. Was the 1978 National Conference on Science Award and he has published more than 160 scientific papers in academic journals. March 17, 2003 in Shanghai, died at the age of 102. <br> Su Buqing is principally engaged in the study of differential geometry and computational geometry, achieved excellent results in affine differential geometry and projective differential geometry research in the general space differential geometry, high-dimensional space conjugate theory, geometric shape design, computer-aided geometric design has made outstanding achievements. The general surface studies, he found four times (third-order) algebraic cone, this major breakthrough has aroused strong repercussions in International Mathematics <br> community. He is our first research the K exhibition space \"experts have indisputable position in the international mathematical community, in terms of radiation differential collection. Youth Su Buqing international mathematical community as the \"Oriental Land rising from a brilliant mathematical star\", he later projective differential geometry, the projective curve Introduction to research has made great achievements, but also internationally recognized as Oriental geometer. \" More than 150 papers. Author of 10 monographs, differential geometry, projective curve Introduction \",\" Introduction to projective surfaces. Ship Lofting project \"research,\" Surface Methodology hull form production process were awarded the second prize of National Science Conference Award and the National Science and Technology Progress. He founded the internationally recognized Zhejiang University school of differential geometry; geometry and projective curve the K exhibition space \", he was awarded the National Natural Science Award in 1956. His many achievements has been quoted extensively in many countries mathematicians or as important content is written into their monograph. <br> Su Buqing not only for future generations, leaving a great asset and brilliant ideas, and love of education, stage teaching 60 years like a day, and trained a large number of mathematical excellence. His influence to rigorous scholarship with his students, the gracious mind inclusiveness with his students, painstaking study spirit inspires his students. He summed up the three practice and train outstanding students, to encourage them to catch up, not block their Road to Success, rush in behind them, pushing them to a. Su Buqing effect \"is formed at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, set up a firm echelon personnel march toward the realm of mathematics. Su Buqing is the dean of the education sector in China, more worthy of a generation of math guru. <br> 1931 Su Buqing decided to return home under the extreme conditions, employed in Zhejiang University. Since information, books pitiful, Professor Su Buqing again across the oceans, day and night to translate, copied back to the 46 papers, more than 20 million words. He and Professor Chen Jiangong lead their disciples to to cave study mathematics. It is at this time that he lit a piece of sacred plateau spark only Pan Cheng-dong, Wang Yuan, Chen Jingrun outstanding contribution to the Goldbach conjecture only country in the International Mathematical Olympiad gold medals. <br> commemorates Su Buqing&#39;s tremendous achievements in the field of mathematics and education, sponsored by Fudan University and other units, the National Ministry of Education approved the establishment of the Su Buqing Math Education Award. <br> Commentary: China&#39;s outstanding mathematicians results achieved countless forever the worthy descendants admiration and learning. <br>'
