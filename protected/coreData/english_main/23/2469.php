'cont'=>'March 23, 1882 (, Imo February fifth day), the the abstract algebra mother of Amy &#8226; Nordisk&#39;s birthday. March <br> 1882 Amy, 23, was born in a Jewish family in Erlangen, Germany, Nordisk (lssjt.cn) father Marx Nord is a professor of mathematics in Erlangen. May be affected by his father&#39;s, Amy Nordisk childhood mathematics special hobby. Because girls are not allowed to enroll in the fall of 1900, she began as lectures auditing students at the University of Erlangen. Until 1904, it was officially registered Ruaierlan root University, specializing in mathematics and Ph.D. in 1907. Amy Nordisk <br> mathematical to by math superstar Hilbert appreciated, they hired her to teach in the University of G&#246;ttingen, but was the professor will be some opposition professors, after Silberman special, Klein and many scientists long-term struggle resolutely 1922, Amy Nordisk, finally became the \"unofficial associate professor of the University of G&#246;ttingen, Speaker generation of math. During this period, Nordisk has published two important papers, given a rigorous mathematical methods for Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity. The work known as Nordisk theorem has become a cornerstone of the theory of relativity, certain aspects of the theory of elementary particles. <br> of Nordisk most important contribution in algebra. She created a new method of algebra, which broke new ground in the development of algebra, she established a commutative ring theory, become an important branch of algebra, this theory in algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, topology, complex The variable function deals with the combination of theoretically important applications. Nordisk worthy of \"the mother of abstract algebra. Nordisk also an important contribution is to train a large number of algebra successor. Chinese algebraist Dr. Zeng Jiongde papers she guided Unfortunately, due to the untimely death of Mr. Tsang abstract algebra fails to bear fruit rapidly in China. in G&#246;ttingen University <br> Nordisk continuous teaching for 13 years, her proven track record, no one has commentary on the professor Unfortunately, in 1933, Hitler came to power only four months, frantically squeezed Jews, Nord was removed from his post, being caught in impoverished. Nordisk to the United States, working in Einstein&#39;s Princeton Institute work. During this time, her side of the lecture, while writing, made outstanding contributions to the human to superhuman willpower to climb the peak of the realm of mathematics, wrote a glorious chapter in the history of the development of mathematics in the world. <br> Nordisk never married. Female mathematician died in 1934, Nordisk back to Germany to visit an old friend of the University of G&#246;ttingen and around, returned to the United States in 1935, had an operation in April, unfortunately, had complications, less than a week, the only crown the pack , at the age of 53 years old. <br>'
