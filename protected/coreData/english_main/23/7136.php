'cont'=>'(Otsugase June 26), July 23, 1995, found that the end of the century comet \"Haier Pope. Haile Bopp comet, <br> Northern Lights exist side by side, (April 1, 1997) <br> in 1995, two amateur astronomers in the United States, Haier and Pope observing Sagittarius globular cluster M70, accidentally discovered a new comet. The calculation results of the preliminary observations allow astronomers to greatly shock: It did run on a very special track, almost perpendicular to its orbital plane of the solar system plane, that is, it will be from the south to the north to bypass the sun and then deep into space, it is The force striking this particular azimuth of the sun&#39;s poles physical state and the edge of the solar system, this comet will provide us with the original letter <br> more its unusual brightness, and found it 10 million kilometers from Earth, brightness than 10, Bi Halei comet reunification in 1985, 250 times brighter in the same distance. After astronomers calculate when the comet after perihelion brightness will reach -1.7 and so on, that the brightest Sirius than throughout the day but also bright, it is known as the end of the century a large comet. <br> Hale - Bopp comet did not disappoint, its form and brightness are basically consistent with the estimated: the wisdom experienced at least five nuclear outbreak, and short and thick dust comet tail. January 1997-February gas comet tail appearance outset longer, and keep the two main and tail, to April or so. March 23, 1997 over the perigee, to April 1st perihelion, brightest reached -0.8. <br> \"Haier - Pope\" is a comprehensive use of human history as CCD (electronic scanning system records images) technology for a long time observing the comet, the photo quality is therefore greatly improved. In In 1996, China&#39;s Yunnan Observatory, one meter mirror CCD device to increase the field of view shot Hale - Bopp comet (partial enlarged) <br>'
