Comprehensive Biochemistry Series autobiography published abroad ¡¤ Biochemistry history volumes published contribution to the development of contemporary biochemistry has gone down in the annals of history. CPPCC National Committee since 1978 the fifth to the eighth member of the Eighth Standing Committee member. now a former member of the Presidium of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Faculty of Biology, director, National Natural Science Fund Committee, a member of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council for many years, served as an honorary member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Third World Academy of Sciences, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. some important domestic and international scientific editorial board of the journal, including China Science and Science Bulletin associate editor of Analytical Biochemistry Biochimica et Biophysica Acta Editorial Board, American Biochemistry FASEB Journal consultancy Editorial 1981-1982 has candidates served as a visiting professor of Harvard University. 1986 - 1990 installments as the U.S. National Institutes of Health Fogarty Fellow <br> Zou Chenglu Academy of Sciences found that the purified cytochrome C and the nature of the differences in the mitochondrial; study of the respiratory chain enzymes, for our enzymatic studies laid the base; responsible for the demolition of the A-and B-chains in insulin synthetic aggregate, identified synthetic routes; The quantitative relationship of the loss of the chemical modification and activity of the protein necessary group formulas and mapping method, called \"Chow formula & rdquo ; mapping; widely adopted on the international irreversible enzyme inhibition kinetic theory and the reaction rate constant measured; cytochrome b three-phase reduction, insulin A chain and B chain containing form a complete molecular necessary information under weak denaturing conditions loss of activity first the whole conformational changes in the molecule, therefore the enzyme active site has a high flexibility and are necessary for enzyme activity, etc., are pioneering work.
