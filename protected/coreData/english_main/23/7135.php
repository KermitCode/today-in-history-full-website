'cont'=>'(Otsugase June 26), July 23, 1995, two amateur astronomers in the United States found that the end of the century comet \"Haier Pope. Haile Pope, <br> <br> comet and aurora borealis exist side by side (April 1, 1997) <br> In July 1995, two U.S. the amateur astronomers Haier and pop observing Sagittarius globular cluster M70, accidentally discovered a new comet. The calculation results of the preliminary observations allow astronomers to greatly shock: It did run on a very special track, almost perpendicular to its orbital plane of the solar system plane, that is, it will be from the south to the north to bypass the sun and then deep into space, it is polarized sun this particular orientation of the physical state and the edge of the solar system original letter this comet will provide us with more force striking is its unusual brightness, found it 10 million kilometers from Earth, and the brightness of the existing 10 Bi Halei comet reunification in 1985 at the same distance as 250 times brighter. After astronomers calculated when the comet after perihelion brightness ¡¤ 1.7 brightest Sirius than throughout the day but also bright, it is known as the end of the century a large comet. <br> Haile Bopp comet did not disappoint, its form and brightness are basically consistent with the estimated: the wisdom experienced at least five nuclear outbreak, and short and thick dust comet tail. January 1997-February gas comet tail appearance outset longer, and keep the two main and tail, to April or so. March 23, 1997 over the perigee perihelion on April 1 to reach ¡¤ 0.8, the brightest. <br> \"Haile Pope\" is a comprehensive use of human history as CCD (electronic scanning system records images) technology for a long time observing the comet, the photo quality is therefore greatly improved. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> In March 1996, Haier (of L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) China&#39;s Yunnan Observatory, one meter mirror shot to increase the field of view CCD device - wave ordinary comet, partial enlarged <br>'
