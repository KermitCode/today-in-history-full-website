'cont'=>'May 23, 1908 (, Shigenobu April 24), winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics John Bardeen was born. The John Bardeen <br> birth \"target =\" _blank \"> Bardeen (1908 -1991 1 30), American physicist, because of the transistor effect and ultra BCS theory of the guide twice won the Nobel Prize in Physics In Badin in 1908 was born in the city of Madison, Wisconsin, USA, Department of Electrical Engineering of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1923 into learning a bachelor&#39;s degree in 1928, obtained a master&#39;s degree in 1929. graduation the Houba Ding staying as electrical engineering research assistant. during the period from 1930 to 1933, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) Bardeen Gulf Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh in the Earth&#39;s magnetic field and gravity field survey methods (lssjt.cn) 1933 Bardeen enter Princeton University research in solid state physics, under the guidance of the EP Wigner, any researcher at Harvard University from 1935 to 1938, and in 1936 obtained a doctorate in Princeton University in 1938 1941, Bardeen served as assistant professor of the University of Minnesota from 1941 to 1945 to work at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, from 1945 to 1951 at the Experimental Institute of Bell Telephone Company of semiconductor and metal conductive mechanism, semiconductor surface properties 1947 Bratton and his colleagues invented a semiconductor transistor month later, Shockley invented the the PN junction transistor, trio won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the transistor effect. <br> 1950 early, Pakistan Ding had already begun to consider the problem of superconductivity. he realized that the electron-phonon interaction is the key to solve the problem. Schriever came to the University of Illinois in 1953 to study for a doctorate in physics under the guidance of the Bardeen and select the the superconducting issues as a doctoral thesis at the recommendation of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Yang Chen-ning, (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) just returned from Columbia University to obtain a doctorate in the near Cooper began and Bardeen and Schrieffer cooperation. 1957 years, Bardeen and Cooper, Schrieffer co-founded the BCS theory of superconductivity has made a reasonable interpretation of the three of them won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. Bardeen also became the first is currently the only won two Nobel Prize in Physics. <br>'
