'cont'=>'October 23, 1910 September 21, (Gengxu years), the death of the founder of modern Thailand Chulalongkorn the Great. <br> Chulalongkorn Chulalongkorn, Rama V, (L $ dj而.c身m) Chinese name Zheng Long, (history TodayOnHistory.com) name Chulalongkorn later revered Chulalongkorn the Great ( September 20, 1853 -1910 years 10, 23), is the fifth generation of monarch Bangkok, Thailand dynasty (reigned from October 1, 1868 to 1910, 23). He is generally regarded as the most power and the great monarch in Thai history, the founder of modern Thailand. <br> I hope that one day my dynasty everyone to become a free man; ...... from heads of state to the children of the common people should be equal education, IV king&#39;s dream and hope; if the everthing Western run, you will not know the bedside in which side, the end of the bed in which side - of Chulalongkorn <br> Chulalongkorn Rama V, the fifth generation of the Bangkok, Thailand dynasty King (in Chulalongkorn times, the official name of the country of Thailand Siam, called Thailand unified in this article). During his reign, launched a self-force rich modern reform movement in contemporary Modernization Reform in the Asia-Pacific region, the impact after the Meiji Restoration in Japan. Snooping around the circumstances of the British and French colonists Rulangsihu, he struggled to maintain national independence, Thailand became the only sovereign state of contemporary Southeast Asia. He raised the prestige of the royal family, After the Thai government in any case frequently change, detract from the stability of the country, because the king as a sign of national unity. Surrounding the politically turbulent years, Thailand has become the mainstay of stable development in Southeast Asia. His top ranking in the list of the Southeast Asian emperors. father of <br> Chulalongkorn, Rama IV, the first sounded a prelude to his reforms. Rama IV that is Prince Meng solid, original to the legal heir of Rama II, but when Rama II died, his succession to the throne Committee to \"unbearable Daren grounds deprived of the right to inherit from his exclusive Muxiong throne for Rama III. So, Meng solid to become a monk, began a long career of penance. Monk Meng solid addition to high attainments in Buddhist positive interaction with Western missionaries, learning English and Western thought and science. 27 years later, he finally returned to the once the throne missed. He began to change the traditional, such as restrictions on slavery, reform of the monetary system, to encourage foreign trade, establish a friendly image of the royal family. 1855, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) Rama IV and the United Kingdom signed a the unequal the \"Pauling treaty\", and Thailand fully opens the door. <br> Rama IV intends to cultivate future generations of enlightened thinking, such as any of his children&#39;s tutor hired Americans Anna. Chulalongkorn grew up in the East meets West cultural environment, inherited the throne in 1868. In addition to early education in the Western factors, when Thailand faced international environment also contributed to his main reason for the reform. <br> in the west of Thailand, the United Kingdom has eroded India, twice British Burma war Burma into British India. On the Malay Peninsula in the south, the British established the Straits Settlements, tight Thailand&#39;s southern gate. East of France through two wars, Vietnam to become a \"protectorate\", and further stretch the Juzhua Cambodia. Neighboring countries a fall, Thailand seems to be difficult to protect themselves. Thailand&#39;s state machinery is still imprinted with a medieval inefficient operation. Chulalongkorn difficult juggling between countries such as Britain, France, Germany, Britain and France want annexation Thailand the other side of the situation, but are reluctant to make Thailand the British and French spheres of influence \"buffer zone\" to temporarily maintain independence. But this is, after all, not the long term, the only reform and self-improvement, the trend of history, in order to survive in the harsh law of the jungle. The Chulalongkorn throne, due to a minor, in the Regency Council in charge of affairs of state, five years after the start Chikamasa. Chulalongkorn&#39;s reform throughout the 37 years of his reign, intersect a progressive, Act., There is no clear start and end. <br> most significant, the most decisive one in the abolition of slavery. For various reasons, the enslaved population in Thailand, although not the majority, but serious damage to the image of Thailand and the capital accumulation phase is the large number of free labor, rather than private slaves. From the from Chulalongkorn Chikamasa to start promulgated the decree to limit slavery to two years before his death, basically completed the abolitionist movement. The liberation of the serfs, is also a big blow to the feudal lords favor centralization. Another focus <br> Bureaucracy reform. Chulalongkorn modeled on the West set up a cabinet, the reform of the local administrative system, the abolition of the feudal system knighted search Tian instead of payment of salaries, local officials are unified by the central appointment and transfer. Set up modernization of the state apparatus. <br> On the military side, Chulalongkorn end of the backwardness of the wartime enlistment, the establishment of a standing army and compulsory military service from 1905. Danes Lane Sher help establish a number of military academies, (L $ dj而.c身m) and focus on strengthening the Navy. Education, Westerners founded the church school to take a tolerant attitude, and create a number of secular schools, specialized schools, to Chulalongkorn his later years, civilian education boom in the country began to form. Financially, the abolition of the the package tax system backward in various industries, to eliminate the tax package pocketed greatly increased state revenue. While the royal family the treasuries with treasury separately, to avoid any member of the royal family squandered state property. Reach neither external nor internal debt \"to Chulalongkorn his later years, even though every year a lot of investment in infrastructure, but the state fiscal year after profitable. <br> addition, Chulalongkorn also established a more mature judicial system and vigorously to the construction of railways, highways, setting up of Posts and Telecommunications. His reforms cover a wide range, and there are indeed some fundamental changes, but did not cause unrest. During his reign, the country smoothly flourishing. (History cn) <br> but Chulalongkorn not advocate wholesale westernization. He once said, \"If everthing Western ran bedside, you will not know which side, the end of the bed in which side. \"For example, he encouraged the spread of English, but against the excessive use of English words in everyday life, he insisted Buddhism the state religion status. In Southeast Asian countries, Thailand is still a traditional Oriental culture kept one of the best countries. <br> Chulalongkorn many times to send a delegation to visit Western countries, and to break the tradition of the King of Thailand can not go abroad, twice went to Europe to visit, which aims to broaden their horizons, strengthen exchanges in Western countries good offices, to protect Thailand&#39;s independent status. <br> However, the overbearing arrogance of the Europeans, Chulalongkorn still unable to get out. In 1893, France looking for an excuse to stir up the two sides dispute, then gunboats entered the Bangkok river, forcing the Thai government signed the Treaty of Bangkok, the subsidiary in Laos, Thailand, was ceded to France under the Indo-China, and reparations of 300 million gold francs . Chulalongkorn this serious illness, even once refused treatment. In 1904, forcing Thailand the treaty completely give up the Mekong east of the land. Chulalongkorn his later years, but also the cost of the ceded territory, the abolition of extraterritoriality of the British and French in Thailand. National independence to maintain, in consideration of the loss of large swathes of territory. <br> Chulalongkorn with Japanese Emperor Meiji in the same era, the two have many similarities are juvenile throne, pressed on the face of the Western powers, including the cross outside the storm began a reborn country reform movement, reform is a top-down manner, and scope throughout the country on all sides. In contrast, Chulalongkorn&#39;s personal role in the reform is greater than the Emperor Meiji. However, the Meiji Restoration, Japan embarked on the ranks of world power, its world impact is much larger than the reform of Thailand, which is far Habitat Emperor Meiji reasons after Chulalongkorn ranking in the Top. Him in the rankings in column 82. the <br> Review: Chulalongkorn launched the drive for reform, both from his contact with Western education, he felt from the heavy pressure of Western powers, while the latter is more important. Although Thailand is not because the reform and become powerful, but the road to a healthy development of in Thailand is also a small country monarch can fulfill the responsibility. <br>'
