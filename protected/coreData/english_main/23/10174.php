'cont'=>'October 23, 1994 (September 19) Awake, China&#39;s high-speed railway vehicle test rig was built in Qingdao. October <br> 1994, (lssjt.cn) of railway vehicles rolling, vibration test stand built and demonstrated success in the Ministry of Railways, Qingdao Sifang Rolling Stock Research Institute, speeds of up to 333 km / h. the first of its kind, but also the speed of China&#39;s railway vehicle test bench highest <br> high-speed railway vehicle test station in the country, indicates that China already has a high-speed test means, and has reached the international advanced level. <br> this test bed, it can simulate passenger and cargo vehicles in the the ideal straight trail the state of motion, to determine the stability of bogies Snake Motion determination of instability critical speed. Can simulate the vehicle curve by the angle of attack between wheel and rail and ultra-high orbit determination of vehicle derailment stability, as well as wheel-rail creep test, the wheel-rail interaction. <br>'
