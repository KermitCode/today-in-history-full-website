(L $ dj而.c身m) <br> important war to this stage, the two sides have been able to generally calculated what battle each other in what circumstances can play different scale campaign several simultaneous compared , the Soviet German calculated accurately, because the Soviet army in local operations, the logistics of cutting-edge protection to what extent, how much front-line battles capacity only after support, some doubts about how much the German. But the Germans away from the local deep into the Soviet hinterland, supply lines on several few, it can play what size campaign in what direction, the duration of the long Soviet computing more clearly. the curved line of defense <br> Soviet General Staff has been calculated, the summer of 1943, the Germans can only support a Kursk arc line of defense battle, and the Germans can only support a north-south pincer attack on the Kursk offensive troops; person unable to attack, and will be the defensive. <br> With Armageddon approaching, both sides mobilization tanks. The preparation of the armored forces, has become a decisive battle to prepare the main event. <br> Nazi Germany has always flaunted the Army, and the of Zhezhi Army places tank force surf in the world. The tanks had swept through Poland, Western Europe, the Balkans, the to act violently moment also in North Africa. In the early days of the Soviet-German war, a mighty army of Nazi tanks had almost equal to the city of Moscow, \"Tiger\" and \"Leopard\" tanks seemed invincible hand, they can not be said to be the most advanced, but the most practical. <br> now, half of Europe in the 24 hours to the German production aircraft, munitions, tanks manufacturer lianzhouzhuan.
