Moss Levin in the X-ray spectra of the elements when the study found that the different elements for generating the X-ray target, the generated characteristic X-ray wavelength different. he found the various elements of the generated characteristic X-ray wavelength Ordering order is consistent with the periodic table in order, he said that this order of atomic number elements of nature is a periodic function of their atomic number found on atomic number is known as Moseley&#39;s law <br> Review: Mo race Levin was killed in the First World War, lived only 27 years old <br>'
