'cont'=>'September 23, 1997 August 22 (Landmarks), the United States and Japan officially announced a new defense cooperation guidelines. <br> 1997 9 23, the United States and Japan, the two governments officially announced in New York had been planned for a long time, \"the US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines\" to amend the proposal. This program greatly expanded the scope and manner of the Japanese military activities in the surrounding areas of Japan, is the most significant changes to the guidelines since 1978. <br> announced the program after the \"2 +2\" meeting of the US-Japan security consultations, that the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, Defense Agency chief Kyuma Chapter born after final approval by the meeting. <br> modifications according to the published program, the focus on \"cooperation in normal situations,\" appear to have a significant impact on Japan&#39;s peace and security situation in the Japanese armed attack occurs against a reaction \"and\" areas surrounding Japan when cooperation of three parts. <br> program provides that, in normal situations, the two countries in addition to intelligence sharing and policy consultations, but also mutual support and cooperation of the United Nations peacekeeping operations and disaster relief. Armed attack in Japan, Japan will be mainly responsible for the first responsibility to take action to resist the attack, and then take appropriate action in support in the United States. <br> Asian countries, particularly concerned about the so-called \"areas surrounding Japan\" when the US-Japan military cooperation program developed detailed provisions. Strengthen intelligence gathering and sharing and policy consultations, and search and rescue operations, relief and deal with refugees, retreating civilians, the imposition of economic sanctions. Japan will provide the U.S. military and civilian airports, ports, logistics, transportation and medical support, supplies and fuel supply in addition to weapons and ammunition, as well as take communications security, air and sea reconnaissance, mine clearance and other military action. This is the revision of the \"US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines,\" the most important content. <br> new approach to the concept of \"areas surrounding Japan\" no clear explanation, just say, \"peripheral, not a geographical concept, but rather to focus on the nature of the situation and decide. <br> September 24, China&#39;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang the new Japan-US defense cooperation guidelines to make a formal answer. <br> Shen Guofang said that the Japan-US security cooperation is a bilateral arrangement formed in a particular historical context, such an arrangement should be strictly limited within the bilateral scope. Otherwise, it is bound to cause upset Asian neighbors will bring complicated factors to the regional security situation. We believe that the strengthening of military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region enjoyed relative political stability, sustained economic growth and active security dialogue situation to expand military cooperation is clearly contrary to the trend of the times. <br> Shen Guofang said, In view of the above-mentioned position, we have been asked Japan and the United States to modify defense cooperation guidelines, including security cooperation on the issue, be careful, do not expand the scope of alliance cooperation, neighboring countries worry about the things not to do so. Especially due to historical reasons, Japan&#39;s security policy orientation of its Asian neighbors has been a very sensitive issue and hope that Japan will learn from the lessons of history, to adhere to the road of peaceful development. <br> Shen Guofang stressed that the Taiwan-related issues is an important reason for China concerned about Japan-US defense cooperation guidelines. As we all know, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, either directly or indirectly, the Taiwan Strait, included in the scope of the Japan-US security cooperation is a violation of China&#39;s sovereignty and interference, which the Chinese government and people must not be accepted. We hope that both Japan and the United States to honor the commitments made by the Chinese side on the Taiwan issue, respect China&#39;s solemn stance on the Taiwan issue, and not to do harm China&#39;s interests and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people&#39;s things. <br>'
