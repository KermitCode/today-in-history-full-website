'cont'=>'(Mao, in the first month, seventh day), February 23, 1855, the German mathematician Gauss&#39;s death. <br> Carl Friedrich Gauss (Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss) (1777 30 1855 23), was born in Brunswick, died in G&#246;ttingen, the famous German mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geodetic scientist. Gaussian is considered to be the most important mathematicians and mathematics prince&#39;s reputation. <br> 1792, 15-year-old Tak the Gaussian to enter Braunschweig Institute. Where Gaussian higher mathematics. Independently discovered the general form of the binomial theorem, number theory on quadratic reciprocity law, distribution of prime number theorem, and arithmetic geometric mean. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> 1795 gauss to enter the University of G&#246;ttingen. Since 1796, 17-year-old Gauss was a very important result of the history of mathematics, is shaped ruler is seventeen edge mapping theory and methods \"and circulated a 2000 Euclidean geometry since the time of ancient Greece The first important supplement. 1807 Gauss became a professor and the local station of the Observatory of the University of Goettingen. Gaussian in his establishment measured on the basis of the method of least squares adjustment theory help, clearing out the trajectory of the celestial bodies. And this way, and found that the trajectory of Ceres. (Lssjt.cn) Ceres discovered by Italian astronomer Pia Sarkozy in 1801, but his illness delayed observation, lost the trajectory of the asteroid. Pia Sarkozy to Greek mythology, the harvest goddess \"(Ceres) to name it, namely Ceres (Planetoiden Ceres), and the location of the previously observed, the global astronomers looking. Gaussian previous three observation data, calculate the trajectory of Ceres. Austrian astronomer Heinrich Olbers found success on the track of the Gaussian calculations of the asteroid. From this Gaussian Mingyangtianxia. Gaussian such writings in the book \"celestial kinetic theory. In the early morning of February 23, 1855, died in G&#246;ttingen. <br>'
