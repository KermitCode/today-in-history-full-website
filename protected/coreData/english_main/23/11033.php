'cont'=>'(Awake, October 15), November 23, 1874, American physicist Theodore Lyman was born. In 1874 11 23 <br> - Theodore Lyman was born, the American physicist <br> Lyman was born in 1874 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States 1893 entered Harvard University to study physics, stayed on to teach after graduation in 1897. 1919 went to the University of Cambridge&#39;s Cavendish Laboratory work for two years, returned to Harvard University in 1921, holding professorships. 1926, Ryman served as director of the Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and is a Fellow of the American Academy. In Boston in 1954, died at the age of 80. <br> Lyman research career dedicated to the study of far-ultraviolet spectrum, and has developed into the vacuum spectrograph capable of measuring wavelengths shorter than 200nm spectral. 1906 Lyman and Millikan cooperation Lyman line is found in the far ultraviolet spectra of hydrogen atoms, and improve the study of the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms, confirms the Rydberg formula, Bohr model and Leeds the spectral term portfolio principle correctness. Thereafter, Ryman observed spectrum of neon, helium, aluminum, magnesium, and other elements of the shortwave solar spectrum components, but does not give satisfactory results. Later, after his death in 1959, the rocket carrying the instrument observed Lyman alpha line in the solar spectrum. In addition, the Ryman also studied the role of ultraviolet sterilization.
