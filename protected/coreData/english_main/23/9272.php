'cont'=>'September 23, 1997 the (Landmarks August 22), the super-parallel computer \"Deep Blue\" farewell Chess. <br> \"Man vs Machine\" super parallel computer beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov of the farewell Chess <br> \"Deep Blue\" <br> 1997 9 23 morning ( EST), the United States, IBM officially announced: defeat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov&#39;s super parallel computer \"Deep Blue\" sensation in the world of \"Man vs Machine\" in the first half of this year, has been satisfactorily completed its historic mission, officially quit chess. the <br> \"Deep Blue,\" announced his retirement on the eve of the Chinese scientists developed development projects the of Dr. Tan Chongren and Dr. Xu Fengxiong the IBM company responsible for the \"Deep Blue\", from \"Man vs Machine\" leads & ldquo ; Deep Blue \"story has accepted the reporter&#39;s interview in Beijing. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> \"Deep Blue\" no the artificial intelligence <br> computer chess and defeated Kasparov, how can we say that it is not \"artificial intelligence\"? However, Dr. Tan Chongren categorically said, \"Deep Blue\" project does not contain the \"artificial intelligence\". Dr. Tan is IBM&#39;s Watson Labs researcher, his longtime automation design, programming, parallel processing and other aspects of the study. When IBM decided Development and chess world champion race \"Deep Blue\" computer, he served as the manager of the development team. He gave the conclusions of the \"Deep Blue\" was undoubtedly the authority. He explained that all computers today, \"Deep Blue\" will not learn, and the only reasoning. Will study the so-called \"fifth generation\" computer has not been studied. \"Deep Blue\" excels is its tireless \"brute force\", the researchers could collect nearly 100 years, 600,000 master chess are stored in the & ldquo ; dark blue \",\" brain \"- large fast array of hard disk system. Deep Blue system is composed of two databases: one is to start the database, the initial steps chess dismount to start a database of about 2 megabytes looking for: design of \"Deep Blue,\" the difficulty focused on finality database. Although both sides are only a few sub. But what the end is ever-changing. \"Deep Blue\" amount of finality database data to 5 gigabytes, which brings together IBM&#39;s state-of-the-art of 32 Chess dedicated processor to work together, it can in every 3 minutes to find from the store in the chess wonderful they should go forward. \"Deep Blue\" <br> in the man-machine war <br> outside the stadium at the same time, IBM&#39;s Web site on the Internet, has become the worldwide \"geek\" who compete to access the hot spots. That instant, the the numerous chess enthusiasts and network fevers have typing on the keyboard, clicking the mouse, the virtual space of the electronic information highway, flock to play against Kasparov, Deep Blue \"race tide. <br> in fact, published on the Internet, \"Deep Blue\" computer game news server is \"Deep Blue\" brothers. Day after the start of the game this year, yet there are 106 national computer enthusiasts flocked to IBM&#39;s Web site, the peak reached 78 million people. IBM&#39;s RS/6000 super parallel computer at first placed. Faced with the avid Internet access, and had to quickly expand the server system. \"Deep Blue\" brethren emergency mobilized last full co-operation of the \"18 Heroes\" to resist loading geek \"overly enthusiastic outside the stadium. <br> \"Deep Blue\" is parallel processing: the man-machine war is parallel processing: the unprecedented boom of Internet access services provided, and parallel processing. This time outstanding 18 sets IBM Parallel Supercomputer complete network information service of the man-machine war, fully demonstrating the high reliability and scalability of these computers, and also verify their security. <br> finished the story, Dr. Tan is very proud. <br> In fact, the \"Deep Blue\" there is a small brothers completed another earthshaking events. U.S. Mars Pathfinder Mars Exploration Program recently triggered a global Martian hot on the application of IBM&#39;s another super parallel computer systems. super parallel computer <br> commercial application is quite extensive. Currently, it manages a large and complex film Kodak warehouse, help the Citibank credit card users vastly different message tendency and provide a valuable basis for the development of competition in the market strategy for MCI phone company. the <br> \"Deep Blue\" to further the practical <br> this year aged 39 the the Dr. Xu Fengxiong, was born in the motherland Taiwan and Taiwan, he is an amateur chess master. Dr. Xu active thinking, he said with a program designed to overcome the human chess master dream he has pursued over the years. When his PhD when known to the world in the development of developing artificial intelligence technology with Carnegie Mellon University, he with the 3-micron chip design and produce a parallel computer named \"food for thought\". He received the degree of Doctor of Computer Science and many other honors outstanding achievements in the field of computer chess and parallel computer. Today, he took on the overall design of the super-parallel computer \"Deep Blue\", and defeated the human world chess champion. <br> run into such a legend, the reporter natural to ask Dr. Xu, there are no plans to use the next generation, or even the next several generations, \"Deep Blue\" confrontation with Nie Weiping or a disciple? Dr. Xu replied very calmly: \"no. \"He explained, Go To consider moves too much, it&#39;s\" gas \",\" flow \"is changing, today a computer can be regarded as over. <br> talking about here, Dr. Tan Chongren took over the topic, he said, the IBM company has invested so much research and development efforts, that is, in order to achieve the commercial applications of parallel computer. He said, and the world&#39;s largest pharmaceutical research laboratories, the IBM company has signed a cooperation agreement, and will help them use the RS/6000 super parallel computer drug design. This can be a new drug research and development time is reduced from the current average of 15 years to 2-3 years. He said, Imagine This means that the number of AIDS patients can save life! Parallel Supercomputer can also improve the accuracy of the forecasts of socio-economic development process. The super high-speed parallel computer processing power is also able to simulate nuclear explosions, global climate modeling and aerospace design, as well as automotive collision course. <br> All in all, the super parallel computer is a step by step towards all aspects of modern society. \"Deep Blue,\" the prospect of unlimited possibilities. <br>'
