'cont'=>'September 23, 1831 (, Xin Mao on August 18), Faraday invented the generator. In In 1831, Faraday invented the generator. (History www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> British scientist Faraday in 1831 discovered the principle of electromagnetic induction. This principle is to play an important role in the process of development of human society, said: \"When the change of the magnetic field lines of the magnetic field, the wire around will be induced current. (Lssdjt.cn) \"<br> Faraday have taken great pains, through research and trial-and-error, and finally found the enormous impact on scientific principles, and he was convinced that this principle can certainly create a power generator can actually. <br> generator machinery can be converted into electrical energy. Your all kinds of time by the prime mover energy reserves of energy is converted to mechanical energy, and then converted to electricity via generators occasions sent to various electricity transmission and distribution network. <br> due to the different forms of energy can be made of different generators. <br> with the use of water resources and the turbine can be made hydrogenerator; reservoir capacity and the high and low head difference can be made of different capacity and speed hydraulic generator. <br> use of resources such as coal, oil, and boilers, gas turbines with, can be made into a turbine generator, this generator for high-speed motor (3000rpm). <br> in addition to use of the various types of wind energy, atomic energy, geothermal energy generators. <br> In addition, due to the generator works divided into DC generator, induction generator and synchronous generator. Are widely used in large generators synchronous generator. (History com) <br> Comments: Electric humanity truly entered the era of civilization. <br>'
