Mammoth <br> Mammoth \"target =\" _blank \"> the mammoth fossil <br> Mammoth is a way of life in the Paleozoic. scientists estimate, about 250 million years to 30,000 years ago, average height of over four meters this behemoth is very common in all continents, although they later for some reason completely disappeared from the face of the earth, but some mammoth travels accidentally fall into the Bingku was covered in a frozen state, so the body to abnormal completely preserved. these in larger quantities to save the great mammoth remains to provide a lot of information about its structure and habits of modern According to written records, Mammoth occupies a prominent position in the original human art. <br> Britain The media recently disclosed (the L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, the three scientists are trying to extract from the mammoth died 40,000 years ago in vivo sperm are frozen for many years, and then use it to make a modern elephant egg fertilization (Today in History TodayOnHistory.com) eventually let the extinct mammoth back to life after generations multiply. modern science and technology has been proven that cross-species mating can be similar to the ancestral gene offspring, after successive generations. learned that the trials have the cow to be successful. scientists extracted from the death of a long bull body frozen sperm gene is injected directly into the egg cells of heifers, bred calf survival. <br> Interestingly, three scientists from three different areas of the British Geological physicist Smalley is one of the world&#39;s few underground radar experts, whose expertise is probing radar for underground and his task is to identify the exact location of the mammoth buried in the ground. Japanese Five Pecks is a professor of veterinary science at a university, he was responsible for a variety of studies on the biological significance of the Mammoth. Russians Lazarev Yakutsk&#39;s Mammoth Museum experts (history www.TodayOnHistory.com ) he knows where I can find the complete remains of the mammoth. <br> Smalley introduced an adventure squad depth in the northern part of Siberia near the Arctic permafrost zone, the expedition members will take a boat along the Kolyma River the most inaccessible places in the world to reach the River permafrost cliffs towering cliffs glaciers tens of thousands of years have not been subject to any damage. expedition members hope to complete mammoth remains dug up one of flesh and blood and even hair in this In the summer of 1997, Smalley and Five Pecks of northeastern Siberia had been a three-week pre-trip, in order to evaluate the feasibility of the project as a whole. (on TodayOnHistory.com) <br> Smalley said last year Summer visits they have found mammoth bone fragments, as well as a complete horse remains frozen ground to bury the past 3 million years, it is reasonable to of the expedition confidence. <br> human last found the remains of mammoths complete time in 1977 when the former Soviet Union gold miners in a coal mine in Siberia and mining, accidentally dug up the the small mammoths corpse of a young as 6 months. <br> recovery mammoth < ; br> <br>'
