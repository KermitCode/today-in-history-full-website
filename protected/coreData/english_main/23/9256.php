'cont'=>'(Jiyou August 12), September 23, 1969, China successfully conducted its first underground nuclear test. underground nuclear test <br> <br> divided into adit and shafts two, originally scheduled for to Adit test for the first time on May 9, 1960, (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m), but in order to obtain practical missile warhead faster, and concentrate on the development of the hydrogen bomb, this test atmospheric tests measuring the power and performance of the warhead instead Adit until at 00:15 on September 23, 1969, when the first nuclear test. December 17, 1978, the second nuclear test adit made a lot of important data, contribution to the underground nuclear test. October 17, 1976, the third adit nuclear test for the first time in the granite. December 19, 1984, the fifth nuclear test adit is the first principle experiment of the neutron bomb. Fengyun verify shells complete success and lay the foundation for a comprehensive breakthrough neutron bomb technology bottleneck and the first neutron bomb nuclear test, and refuted the allegations of the United States on China to \"steal\" the neutron bomb secrets on schedule. Singh ear <br> selected Lop Nur in northwest China in April 1967 for the shaft nuclear test site, this way the main types of underground nuclear tests. April 1975 drilled 300 meters deep and 2.5 meters in diameter, the first bite granite shaft, but it was not until 09:00 when in October 1978, 14 first shaft nuclear test successfully. Atmospheric nuclear test on October 16, 1980, China&#39;s nuclear test later comprehensive underground; including the neutron bomb and the nuclear tests in recent years, also have adopted the shaft way. In the 1960s to the 1970s, due to insufficient understanding of the laws of science, failed nuclear test whole or in part, but the percentage was not high. <br> since November 2, 1964, the foreign start recording Lop Nur seismic data, seismic records of the Seismic Research Network and seismic joint research institutions from the global standardization, availability of a particular waveform, part of the seismic stations on a regular basis to the U.S. National Earthquake Information Center and the U.S. Agency for International Seismological Centre report. The mid-1990s, the United States used the computer program three times a day to automatically access the database of the National Earthquake Information Center, monitoring the situation of China&#39;s nuclear test. Western since October 3, 1972, the use of commercial satellite reconnaissance Lop Nur nuclear test site, multi-spectral scanning the reflected beam vidicon terrain mapper, high-resolution camera, infrared detection devices, the space shuttle synthetic aperture radar, and other, The astronauts manual photography. The Lop Nur had chosen about 2300 kilometers west of northern west of Dunhuang, Gansu Province, four locations in the north of Lop Nur in Xinjiang, the Chinese and Russian experts believe that the region 160 km west of Dunhuang best. Nuclear test site is divided into three zones. Malan Science City is located in the proving ground northwest, the main command post and technicians residential area near the intersection point of the two trunk roads. Malan tens of kilometers northwest of a confidential Institute, the nuclear test center, surrounded by mountains, a foreign road. Nuclear test proving ground south-east of the desert far from the Malan. Central partition between Malan partition and the Southeast Division, an underground nuclear test site, but the early years were also several low-yield nuclear test on the ground. The Central Division is divided into three underground nuclear test zone; southern test area in the mountains; September 22, 1969 and 1975, 27, 2010, the first two times underground nuclear test on this. The two nuclear tests test the underground nuclear explosions closure technology. Two tests after the nuclear test adit transferred to the west test area, nuclear tests in the test area are low-yield test earthquake weapons test data and nuclear security of the examination centers in the test at the same time, reasonable. The principle of the neutron bomb test and the first test explosions are carried out in this. Eastern test area between the Western Hills a low slope, deep shaft underground nuclear test. The nuclear tests in recent years a lot of this, including the the Dongfeng -41 warhead test. <br> until the end of May 1998, the world total of the 2058 nuclear tests, which the United States 1032 times, 715 times the former Soviet Union, France 210, Britain 45, China 45 India 5 times, (lssjt.cn) of Pakistan 6 times <br>'
