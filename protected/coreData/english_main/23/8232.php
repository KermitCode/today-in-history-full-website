'cont'=>'On the ninth day of July (JiMao years), August 23, 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. The Soviet representative <br> Molotov on the Soviet-German non-aggression pact was signed <br> Ribbentrop by plane to leave for Moscow on August 22, 1939. He carried a Hitler&#39;s personal credentials and hold the power effective immediately after signing a non-aggression treaty and other agreements \"concluded with the Soviet Union, but also with a large entourage. The first night, the German delegation overnight Konigsberg in East Prussia, Schmidt said Dr. Ribbentrop worked there the whole night constantly same of Berlin and ²®Ï£ÌØË¹¼Ó Gordon through telephone, and In preparation for talks with Stalin and Molotov made a lot of notes. <br> two \"vulture\" transport plane carrying the German delegation arrived in Moscow on August 23 noon. In the embassy after a hurried lunch, Ribbentrop hurriedly rushed to the Kremlin to meet with the Soviet dictator and he a member of the Foreign Affairs of the People. The first meeting continued for three hours. The meeting of the German-Ribbentrop told Hitler \"Express\" telegraph to perform well. Telegram from German Foreign Minister to determine, there is not any difficulties on the Soviet Union&#39;s exposure to Greek to be Le waged war outside the terms of the non-aggression pact reached an agreement. In fact, according to his report, the only difficulty is how to divide up the stolen goods, such an apparently small problem. Russians German acknowledge Latvia Lee packet and the temperature Road two Xiaogang \"within their sphere of influence\". The whole territory of Latvia program in the division of the boundaries of the sphere of influence of the two countries of the Soviet Union side, this requirement is not much of a problem, Hitler quickly agreed. Ribbentrop also told after the first meeting of the heads of state said, \"is expected carved out spheres of influence throughout Central and Eastern Europe will be entered into a secret protocol. To \"<br> all files - a non-aggression treaty and secret protocols - hold a second round of talks in the Kremlin in the evening when signing. Germans and Russians agreement too easy, so this has been open to the next morning, one or two minutes banquet-meeting, most of the time not spent any serious bargaining, but is used to world situation, a country a country warm and friendly discussions, the middle is also full of toast toast of the Kerim Lin Guanqing wish it was absolutely essential. <br> two years later, when the German army in violation of the above-mentioned treaties and incursions into Russia, Stalin still think this ugly trade he was carrying the British and French military delegation to Moscow for negotiations with Hitler justified. July 3, 1941 to boast he said in a broadcast to the Russian people: \"We guarantee our access to a year and a half of peace and prepare their own strength to fight back the enemy may, if daring violation of the treaty in France and Germany to invade China then. This is no doubt we won, and France and Germany lost. \"<br> Is not exactly the case, and since then, the people on this point has been controversial. This is a despicable trading gave Stalin a breathing space - Russian called peredyshka - as Tsar Alexander I in 1807 on behalf of Erxi Te from Napoleon&#39;s hands and Lenin in 1917 in Brest - established Rostov Trask achieved, as it is obvious. It is also within a short period of time to the Soviet Union is a far forward positions in Russia outside the boundaries of the original, including the bases in the Baltic countries and Finland - and pay a price for Polish, Latvia, Estonia and Finland people. Of particular importance is that the official Soviet diplomatic history \"and later as emphasized as it can be assured Russia, Russia after attack by Germany, Western countries have also irrevocably involved against third Empire of the war, the Soviet Union would not like Stalin in 1939, an entire summer worried, alone against the powerful German. <br> All these are facts no doubt. But there are arguments to the contrary. To Hitler&#39;s U-turn when the attack on Russia, Poland, and the French army, and the British company sent to the expeditionary force has been destroyed, so Germany can mobilize the whole of Europe human and material resources toward Russia, and can bound the hands and feet of Western battlefield but no longer exists. 1941, between 1942 and 1943, a full three years, Stalin has been complaining about no second front in Europe, Russia has had to bear almost all the pressure of the German army. 1939-1940 now able to pin down the German army has a Western battlefield. If Russia supports Poland rather than give it a knife in the back, it is also impossible to utterly half raids. Not only that, if Hitler knows he must fight Russian to fight Poland and Britain and France, is likely to simply unlikely. Is politically timid German generals, according to their subsequent testimony in Nuremberg judge also may standing heel to war against an alliance with such powerful. According to the French Ambassador in Berlin, said at the end of May when, of Keitel and Bolao Hitch had warned Hitler, if Russia is to participate in the enemy party to overcome the possibility is very small. <br> Since participate in the League of Nations, the Soviet Union had set a certain moral force appeared in the world, the defenders of peace and the face of the main opponents of the fascist aggression. Now, the kind of moral capital has lost all net. is most serious <br>, due to the completion of this sordid trading with Nazi Germany, Stalin has issued a war is necessary unveiling of the signal, this war will surely evolve into world wars. There is no doubt that he understands this. Later, the facts show that this is the biggest mistake of his life. <br>'
