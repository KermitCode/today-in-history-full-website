'cont'=>'July 23, 1916 (, hare on June 24), the British chemist Sir William Ramsay&#39;s death. William Ramsay Sir, <br> <br> the KCB (English: Sir William Ramsay, 1852 October 2, 2011 -1916 years 7, 23), British chemist, 1904 Connaught Bell Prize for Chemistry. In In 1887, William Ramsay to University College London as a chemistry department. His life&#39;s most famous research it is from this period. From 1885 to 1890, he published several important papers on nitrogen oxides. These studies he later the outstanding achievements laid the foundation. In In 1894 4 19 evening, Ramsay took part in a seminar organized by the Rayleigh. Rayleigh previously found that the nitrogen gas obtained by the decomposition of ammonium nitrite and \"nitrogen\" is extracted from the air to have different densities. Rayleigh and Ramsay discussion, decided to work together to explore the reasons for this phenomenon. Them immediately in each laboratory this study, and almost every day to keep in touch and keep each other informed of the progress of the work. In August of the same year, Ramsay and Rayleigh announced discovered argon elements. In 1895, he was isolated from the yttrium uranium helium, to prove this before only by the French astronomer Pierre Jean Sen elements observed in the solar spectrum on Earth there. In the ensuing years, Ramsey have been found in neon, krypton and xenon. In 1903, he and Frederick Soddy cooperation helium detected in radium. In 1910, he and Robert Whitelaw - Gray isolated radon, and the determination of the density of the highest known gas. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> 1904, \"found the elements of the inert gas in the air, and to determine their position in the periodic table, William Ramsay was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <br> comment: he found several inert elements. <br>'
