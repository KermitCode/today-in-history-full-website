The cell theory Engels hailed the three major discoveries of natural science in the 19th century, played a huge role in promoting the development of the biological sciences.

Therefore, some of the basic content of the doctrine, such as the formation of the cell itself, at the time they did not receive sufficient experimental evidence. Schleiden that the new cells are generated from the nucleus of the old cells; Schwann that the new cells are generated from the crystallization process of the organic matter in the old nucleus.
