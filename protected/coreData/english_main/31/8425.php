'cont'=>'(Jiashen July 13), August 31, 1944, Mao Zedong discusses the basic problems of the new democratic society. <br> 1944 31, 2009, Mao Zedong the basis of the new democratic society. explained in a letter to Yan&#39;an \"Liberation Daily\" newspaper publisher Bo Gu (TodayinHistory.cn) Mao Zedong pointed out, the new democratic society based on the factory (Social factories, public and private) and cooperatives (labor-exchange teams included), not scattered individual economy. The dispersed individual economy - family farming and cottage industry is the basis of the feudal society, not the foundation of a democratic society (the old democracy, a new democracy, socialism, covers included), which is Marxism different from the place of populism. Simple words, the new democratic society based on the machine, not by hand. We have no access to machines, so we have not yet victory. If we can never get a machine, we can never win, we will perish. The countryside is now a temporary base, not the main basis of the democratic society as a whole. By agricultural base to an industrial base, it is precisely the task of the revolution. Liberation of humanity is also a democracy must include the feudal revolution. Some people say that we ignore or suppress individuality, which is wrong. Bound personality including, but not liberation, there would be no Democratic nor socialist. <br>'
