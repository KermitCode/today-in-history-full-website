'cont'=>'December 31, 1994 (Awake in the winter months&#39;s Eve), Makumbi isolated sperm production genes. In <br> 1994 12 31, the brigade British scholars, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming Zoology of Makumbi breakthrough in human genome research, the world&#39;s first successfully isolated the gene responsible for controlling the produce sperm. This gene was named as a the Makumbi gene. <br> Makumbi discovery by the international attention of biologists. The world biology authoritative journal \"Cell\", published on December 31, 1993 the results of this study. British newspaper \"Independent\", \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Scotsman\" also made a detailed report. Scientists believe that this discovery could lead to the male infertility produce new therapies, but also provide a new way to achieve male contraception. <br> scientists found that about 1/3 of infertility cases are caused because men can not produce enough active sperm. 1976, (Lssdjt.com) Italian Scientists speculate that the Y chromosome, a region has a very important role in sperm production. This area called azoospermia factor, it is very likely that control sperm genome. This gene is located 6 million base pairs. The Makumbi task is to identify the genes in this 6 million base pairs, just like the difficulty of finding a needle in a haystack. In 1992, Makumbi research progress, reduced to the position of this gene on the Y chromosome of 600,000 base pairs. In September 1993, Makumbi isolate this gene. It is azoospermia factor protein. Although the exact function of this gene is not fully understood, but it can be concluded that it is to control sperm genes responsible for manufacturing activities. <br> Makumbi this gene direct guidance, control and participate in the cells on the protein synthesis. If this gene is mutated or defect will result in a loss of information, resulting in the male can not produce normal sperm or do not produce sperm and the loss of reproductive capacity. <br> Makumbi also in other mammals such as mice, sheep, cattle body found in genes that control sperm production. <br> British scientists said, after the discovery of this gene is an important step toward DNA analysis and diagnosis of male infertility, to understand the function of this gene in the evaluation of this achievement, will help us to find the implementation of male a new method of contraception. The doctor can correct the defect gene through gene therapy, to achieve the purpose of the treatment of male infertility, can achieve the purpose of contraception \"Close\" gene. Makumbi intend his research eventually applied to male contraception. <br>'
