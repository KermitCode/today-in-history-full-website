The shadow of violence and terror before the occurrence of the Holocaust, has been shrouded in Qiena Luo City and its surrounding areas. It began November 13 waterfalls town Indian religious ceremonies by more than 500 local members of the paramilitary organization try to stop. Next day, Qiena Luo a government official the people stab in the back. Mayor Arias blamed the vicar Miguel Hurley, said the pastor inciting the Indians to the assassination and intimidation Hurley pastor careful melon head \". After a few days, more and more people missing, was the abduction and assassination. By the end of November, at least 10 people were killed. The town of South Hadley Mystic Democratic Revolution Party 10 families were driven out of the town.阿克特阿尔 Village 4 sympathy for the Zapatista guerrillas people houses were burned. The Xi Dala town of 150 democratic revolutionaries family fled Shenghao Akin town 35 Institutional Revolutionary Party people move out of his hometown.

The so-called paramilitary organization, in fact, the law does not recognize a variety of local and private armed, the loose armed vigilante groups such as the size of the town to deal with the guerrillas organized, large landowners and large estates traditional escort. The members of these paramilitary organizations \"are a group of recognized masters do not recognize the law recognized the money regardless of the father and mother of the people. <br> fact, before the uprising of the Zapatista guerrillas, the state of Chiapas is not a peaceful place. This state is located in southern Mexico, high mountains and steep slopes, dense forests and swift rivers, inaccessible, is Mexico&#39;s most poor and backward and most volatile state. Statewide since most of the residents do not have access to electricity, more than 50% of the population is illiterate, many villages all Indian residents, still living a life of slash-and-burn. Before the advent of the Zapatista guerrillas, the state there are serious tribal conflicts, family disputes and residents of sectarian conflict. Arias mayor&#39;s family is one of the two rival local family. The guerrillas appear more intense this contradiction, the conflict is more acute. In 1998, the state of Chiapas will hold gubernatorial elections, 11 City mayor general. Therefore, the public opinion in the recent the Chiapas violence and terrorist incidents endless stream of guerrilla activity, not unrelated to the 1998 local elections. <br> Arias insisted no dry massacre depends Next forensics results, whether the court finds him guilty, and the alleged massacre suspect&#39;s trial.

Even if the accused of the the Arias charges can not be established, as the mayor can not shirk its responsibility for the tragedy, which is the local committees of the Institutional Revolutionary Party not wait for the court out elected a new mayor. Mexico is under great pressure from another perspective, the events of the Holocaust always have a scapegoat to avoid people criticized the government weak investigations. <br>'
