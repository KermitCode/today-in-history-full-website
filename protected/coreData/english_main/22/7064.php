'cont'=>'July 22, 1822 (, Imo June fifth day), the founders of modern genetics, Gregor Mendel&#39;s birthday. <br> in the middle of the 19th century, Austria called Mendelian biology teacher, called plant hybridization test to explore the secrets of plant growth in the campus. After dozens of repeated experiments, he found that: (a) has a relatively traits pure parental hybrid, because all individuals have a relative character traits it appeared role, first generation traits. Such as safflower peas with white flowers pea hybrids, the first generation are saffron, saffron on white flowers is dominant. He said the the called \"dominant law\". (B) in the sub-second generation performance of the separation, no longer always safflower, both saffron and white flowers, as the ratio of three to one. He called this \"separation law. (C) He also found that the phenomenon of a separate allocation in the relative traits hybrid two pair or two pairs of the second generation. He called this \"independent distribution law. Based on these experiments, he first hereditary units (now called genes) concept. These came to be known as \"Mendel&#39;s birthday.
