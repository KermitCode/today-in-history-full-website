'cont'=>'July 22, 1888 (June 14 Lunar New Year), Russian microbiologist, biochemist Waxman was born. Waxman, <br>, Russia - American microbiologist. Born July 22, 1888 Russia Puri Ruki; died in Hyannis, Massachusetts, on August 16, 1973. Waxman away from Russia in 1910, the United States. He entered Rutgers University study, graduating in 1915, became a U.S. citizen in 1916. Later, he went to the University of California education; Ph.D. at the school in 1918, and thereafter returned to Rutgers University to teach. He is particularly interested in the micro-organisms living in the soil; 1937 when Du Bois found in a soil microbial fungicides, soil microbial immediately become a new research direction. This has prompted people to make a new evaluation of Fleming&#39;s penicillin, especially since the outbreak of the Second World War, a great need for the wounded soldiers to provide a variety of new methods of handling infected. Waxman sterilization chemicals obtained from microbes to create a new term - antibiotics, at the same time, he began looking for such chemicals. Dubos fungicides and penicillin (TodayinHistory.cn) both only gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, does not work. Therefore, the Waxman substances uniform Gram-negative bacteria, particularly interested. He happened to get a Streptomyces family mold; This mold is the beginning he was a graduate student engaged in research. 1943, he finally separated from which an effective resistance of gram-negative bacterial antibiotic called streptomycin. May 12, 1945, humans first successful application of streptomycin. As a result of this discovery, Waxman won the 1952 Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology Prize. The prize money for the Rutgers University Research Fund. Streptomycin mildew resistance slightly larger, however, because it found, in order to get other antibiotics on soil microbial actively and systematically explore soon discovered tetracycline. <br>'
