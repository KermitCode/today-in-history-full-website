'cont'=>'March 22, 1993, the World Water Day (February 30) πÔ”œ. <br> the 47th United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 193, taking into account all social and economic activities are greatly dependent on the availability and quality of freshwater, but it is not widely recognized that water resources are calculated and paid to improve economic productivity, and improve the role of social welfare; With population growth and economic development, many countries will soon fall into the plight of the water shortage, economic development will be restricted; need to promote the conservation and sustainable management of water at the local level, the National level, regional and international public awareness ask. Therefore, the General Assembly decided based on the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Chapter 18 of \"21st Century Agenda for Action\", from 1993, established on March 22 of each year as \"World Water Day\". <br> the world&#39;s freshwater resources are limited, the global freshwater reserves of 350 million billion cubic meters, but the use of surface water and groundwater for human life and production of only 105 trillion cubic meters. Man of the world&#39;s freshwater use up to 4.13 trillion cubic meters a year; With the continued growth of the world population, it is estimated that the global annual water consumption will be increased to 7 trillion cubic meters in 2000. Then freshwater resources per capita consumption of more than 20% less than they are now. important foundation <br> the Water Resources springs national economy and social development, with the development of agriculture, industry and urbanization, national water consumption increased dramatically, has caused a worsening water crisis. At the same time, the traditional mode of consumption of water resources development and the lack of cost-effective high-speed development is a serious threat to the sustainable use of water resources. According to statistics, the country more than fifty countries and regions in the world, water shortage, coupled with the irrational use of water, a large number of waste water and sewage discharged into water bodies, many freshwater resources lost its use value. Worldwide are currently around 500 billion cubic meters of sewage emissions, resulting in 55,000 cubic meters of water pollution, resulting in drinking water of 10 million people in substandard things health requirements, each year at least 10 million lead to a variety of infectious diseases due to unclean drinking water. Experts predict that the issue of water resources will become the most important natural resource issues facing mankind in the 21st century. Around the world if not great importance as soon as possible and solve this problem, the water crisis is likely to come earlier than the food crisis or the oil crisis. <br> now, the world&#39;s water shortage is very serious, there are 28 countries classified as water-scarce countries or severe water shortage in the country. Expected in another 30 years, water shortages population will reach two, three billion, which indicates that the water crisis is approaching. <br> to solve the problem of water shortage threat to human survival, more and more countries in the world have to act, and take active measures to protect water sources to prevent contamination. Agricultural and industrial water accounted for 70% and 25% of the world&#39;s total water use, therefore, go the path of development of water-saving agriculture and industry has received some national attention. water resources total <br> China at 2.8 trillion cubic meters, ranking sixth in the world, but per capita consumption is among the 88, one of the water-poor countries in the world. <br> World Water Day to remind people of the world, water conservation and rational use of water, protection of water resources <br>'
