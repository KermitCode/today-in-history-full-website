'cont'=>'September 22, 1791 (, Xinhai August 25), the British physicist and chemist Faraday was born. the <br> electrical capacitance units called \"Farah\". Why unit? \"Farah\" This is to commemorate the famous chemist, physicist Michael Faraday was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Faraday electrical tremendous contribution. <br> Faraday childhood is a bitter child September 22, 1791, his father was a blacksmith family was poor, Faraday childhood read only a few of the enlightening reading. was 13 years old, his lunch on the newsboy, books, newspapers suppliers column wave see his clever and diligent, he recruited into nail bookstore as an apprentice. books are piling up in the nail bookstore, Faraday, such as hunger and thirst in their spare time they read a variety of books. \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" article about electrical, so his strong interest in the natural sciences. He took advantage of used goods produced static electricity from the motor, simple chemistry and physics experiments, and also take advantage of the spare time to listen to scientific lectures. (lssjt.cn) the one column wave patrons applaud Faraday&#39;s studious spirit, donated tickets for the Royal Academy, he had the opportunity to hear the speech of the famous chemist David speak to David all recorded, go back further study in 1812 [而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m Faraday apprenticeship introduced to David when temporary scribe David looked Faraday lecture notes, very much appreciated, and they hired him as a lab assistant., Faraday began his scientific career. <br> 1813 In the fall, David married a wealthy young widow, decided to go to Europe for their honeymoon. butler and footman, well aware of the widow spoiled the gas wayward reluctant told to go, and thus was fired so that Faraday will be a set of three duties of the assistant, housekeeper, servant to accompany David to travel the daytime he mainly worked alone at night after the rest of the master, his reading experiment this trip, he saw a lot of well-known scientists, and participate in a variety of academic exchange activities learned French and Italian, greatly broadened my horizons as a friend Faraday said: \"He (Faraday) on the University in Europe, his teacher&#39;s exam is the master of his CI Hou, and Mudai Wei the name from those celebrities. <br> 1815, Faraday after returning immediately and go all out to carry out scientific research. and he boldly various trials, sometimes even risking the danger of life. Once for the chlorine experiment knowingly chlorine toxic, personally inhalation of chlorine in order to verify the nature. willing to risk and hard-working spirit, so he rapidly made a series of achievements in science in 1816, he published the first scientific papers ; 1818, he studied alloy steel discovered to add trace metal elements can affect the performance of the steel, and in 1820, his first with replacement reaction made of two kinds of carbon chloride; 1823, he liquefied chlorine; 1825 from oil isolated benzene, chemical test also made of glass; 1824, (? v in the history of this?? com) he was elected to the Royal Society, when he was 33 years old; following year he was promoted to the laboratory director of the Royal Institute of He After years of trial-and-error, and finally announced in the October 17, 1831, you can use a permanent magnet to generate current, the magnetic force into electricity, which is well-known principle of electromagnetic induction. using this principle, he created the world&#39;s first induction generators. <br> Faraday&#39;s motto is: \"lighting like candles man, a sub-thermal hair spectroscopic, loyal and steadfast to contribute their efforts to the great cause of humanity.\" Indeed, not a day in his life is not for the contribution to mankind, until August 25, 1867, he died peacefully in the work chair. <br>'
