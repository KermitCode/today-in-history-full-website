'cont'=>'August 22, 1647 (July 22, Chinese New Year), born French inventor Dennis Pa level. the <br> When you use a pressure cooker to cook steamed rice, time saving 1/2 to 4/5, you conceivable over who is the inventor of the pressure cooker? <br> invented pressure cooker is a French physicist, mathematician, inventor Dennis Pa level. Born in Pago level \"target =\" _blank \"> Pago Ping, born in France on August 22, 1647 Blois City In Pago level in 1681 published his first important invention -\" digest pot \", which initial pressure cooker. utilize the greater the steam pressure in the sealed container, the principle of the higher boiling point of water, with high pressure and high temperature of the pot quickly the food is cooked, saving a lot of time. Pago the \"digest pot\" to ribs cooked like aspic Royal Society members to participate in the \"dinner\", to taste the \"digest pot\" powerful and achievements. <br> Later it was replaced with a \"pressure cooker\" The name of the the \"digest pot\". pressure cooker in medical effectively sterilizing, alpine plateau, the pressure cooker is particularly useful, because there is low air pressure, low boiling point of water, pot generally unfamiliar rice paper industry, pressure cooker to quickly cook the wood chips wood pulp. pressure cooker is also widely used in industries such as food, canned, <br> 1681 Pa Ping was elected a member of the Royal Society. Subsequently, he designed a atmospheric pressure to drive the engine, but failed After that he was in Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany hardship was removed until 1687, Pa level until the age of 40 official titles: professor of mathematics at the University of Marburg in Germany he knew their knowledge in mechanical aspects of a great purpose, therefore adhere to the research, testing, within one year of the invention of the centrifugal pump, for urban water supply and mine ventilation In <br> 1690, Pago level research steam engine, done a lot of experiments, published papers, introduce steam expansion pushes the piston movement, and the subsequent condensation to form vacuum. principle of this paper After various gas engine. Pago level principle, combined with practical application, and hope to start the vessel with a steam engine, he had made with a steam engine through the gears transmission paddle leaves instead of the oars of a boat, but the test in Germany Fulda River, unfortunately barge crashed Pa level think London is a large port, but also a need for new vessels, did give Germany back to London, then He has over sixty years. (history. cn) <br> was a man named Sai Weier, made of a steam engine, in the exhibition of the Royal Society, Pa level to be identified, Pa Ping significant improvements, but Sai Weier not agreed to improve the So Pa level design of the new steam engine, ready to start the vessel Pa level of life energy and income are used for scientific research thrifty life, life poverty Royal Society had to get the support he asked for &#163; 15 to improve boiler test will permit the Ming Pa level of the steam engine game Will be far superior. However, Sai Weier powerful (history today www.lssdjt.com ) lest Pa successfully tested, because, as his steam engine will be of no value to lose autocratic Sai Weier from blocking, resulting in Pago level reasonable request was unreasonably refused, a major invention was strangled in the cradle Among Pa level, (Lssdjt.com) disappointed in poverty and obscurity in 1712 left the earth, aged 65 years. <br>'
