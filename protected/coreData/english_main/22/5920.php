'cont'=>'(πÔ”œ May third), June 22, 1993, the successful development of our Galaxy II computer digital simulation. <br> 1993 6 22, mark another major breakthrough in China&#39;s high-tech sector, \"Galaxy all-digital simulation-II\" computer through the national identification. <br> experts believe that the completion of this national key scientific and technological projects, that our ability to develop simulator has entered the ranks of the leading international. <br> computer simulation is a high-tech computer system mode like physical systems. High-performance simulation computer, a real-time simulation of large and very large in the fields of aviation, aerospace, weapons, transportation, energy, chemical, has a unique and important role, has been the developed countries to focus on the development of high-tech products. <br> According to experts, developed by the National University of Defense Technology \"Galaxy simulation-II\" is currently the most advanced computer system for dynamic continuous system simulation. It by the front-end machine, multiple parallel processors, integrated I / 0 system and integration of the integrated simulation environment, the precision is the word length of 65-bit floating-point format, emulation capability 10 times in 1985 and the birth of \"Galaxy simulation-I & rdquo ;, equivalent to 5-50 times the General million times large computer, to ensure real-time and high fidelity simulation. Advanced software systems, rich, not only compatible with international popular simulation language and compiler speed, high efficiency of code running. <br> It is understood that the technical indicators of \"Galaxy simulation-II\" is better than similar models, high cost performance, market competitive advantage, laid the foundation for industrialization, into the international market. <br>'
