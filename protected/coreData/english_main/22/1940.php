'cont'=>'(Jiazi u) in the first month, February 22, 1984, Deng Xiaoping met with the delegation of the Georgetown University Research Center for Strategic and International. In 22, <br> 1984 Deng Xiaoping met with the delegation of the Georgetown University Research Center for Strategic and International. Deng Xiaoping said in the meeting: we propose the mainland and Taiwan reunification is reasonable. After reunification, Taiwan is still engaged in its capitalist continent to build socialism, but a unified China. One China, two systems. The question of Hong Kong as well, one China, two systems. Hong Kong and Taiwan, Hong Kong is a free port. Solve many disputes in the world like this approach, I think it is desirable. If you do not want war, only to take such a way that I have just mentioned. This will be accountable to the people, the situation can be stabilized, and the long-term stability, not injury which party. I also imagine that some international territorial disputes, can not talk about sovereignty, to jointly develop first. This problem, from a respect for reality, to find a new path to solve.
