With the average distance of the sun is 1.52 astronomical units, or 227,940,000 km. Equatorial diameter is 53% of the Earth&#39;s, the quality of Earth 11%, the density is 3.9 times that of water, the orbital period 687 days, the rotation period of 24 hours 37 minutes. On Mars has seasons six long months, on a quarterly basis. The surface of Mars, unlike the moon as densely covered with craters, more like rocks on Earth, volcanoes and desert areas. Much like the Earth due to its surface, in the past people have always thought that Mars is a planet of the solar system most likely to have life.

However, the scientists also found that, in some places on Mars steam more, many organisms on Earth can survive under these conditions. So, now can not be absolutely sure that there is no possibility of the existence of life on Mars. <br> Mars has two moons, called Phobos. One near the Martian, the average distance of about 9400 km; Second farther away from the Mars, the average distance of about 23,500 kilometers. Rotation cycle around Mars were 7:39 and 30 hours 30 minutes. (Lsjt.org) <br>'
