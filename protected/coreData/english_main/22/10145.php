'cont'=>'October 22, 1981 (September 25), yau, the Cancun meeting. <br> Cancun Mexico tourist destination, it is located in the sea to the southeast of Mexico, is a scenic island from a height overlooking it like a water snake swimming in the boundless expanse of blue. October 22, 1981, this beautiful island is more subject to worldwide attention, because here was held first by the heads of state or heads of government of the 14 developing countries and 8 developed countries, including China, to participate \"International Conference on Cooperation and Development\" - \"Cancun meeting. <br> The meeting was held in the context of the south and north sides of deepening economic relations have become increasingly. As we all know, the majority of developing countries achieved political independence, made a lot of efforts in developing the national economy, the different levels of development, and the degree of dependence on the developed countries also decreased. They average annual economic growth rate in the 1960s and 1970s, respectively, 5.6% and 5.3%, higher than the 5% and 3.1% of the developed countries. Their national economic structure and the structure of exports of goods have undergone a certain degree of change, by 1979, the proportion of manufactured exports of these countries has increased to 21%. (Lsjt.net) <br> However, the old international economic order is not with the above changes. Developed countries through the activities of some international financial institutions and multinational companies in various areas of the world economy continues to be in a monopoly position. Developing countries in the production, trade, technology, and monetary and financial aspects, are subject to unfair and unequal treatment. The profits of the developed countries to invest in developing countries than investment in the developing countries themselves about twice as high interest rates. <br> In view of the above reasons, the majority of developing countries is an urgent requirement to change the old international economic relations, and to get rid of dependence on the developed countries. This fight as early as in the 1950s during the Bandung Conference that opened the prelude to the beginning of the 1970s, there has been a new turn. 6th special session of the United Nations in 1974, developing countries clearly put forward the proposition of establishing a new international economic order, and by the \"establishment of a new international economic order, the Declaration and Programme of Action\", forcing the developed countries for the first time officially acknowledged that economic on the injustice caused by the threat to world security and peace. In 1979, developing countries and global recommendations of the international negotiations. In the same year, the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to launch global negotiations. However, due to the tough stance of the United States, 1980, the 11th Special Session of the General Assembly and the 35th Session of the UN General Assembly failed to reach an agreement on the agenda and program of global negotiations. It is in this case, Mexico and Austria, 11 foreign ministers meeting at the end of 1980 and early 1981, the two prepare for the convening of the North-South Summit in Cancun. <br> formal summit meeting, the participating heads of governments on the North-South economic relations to a \"constructive and positive spirit\" talk about their own views, developing countries hope to ease the contradiction between north and south, narrowing the developing countries through dialogue and the gap between the developed countries, accelerate the independent development of the national economy. Chinese representatives at the meeting put forward the five principles of the Chinese government on the establishment of a new international economic order. Western Europe, Japan, Canada and other developed countries, noted that the status and role of developing countries in the international political and economic, advocated the strengthening of North-South cooperation to improve the international economic relations, the two-day conference. After the meeting, due to the developed countries in the early 1980s caught the longest postwar duration of economic recession, the government effort focused on solving domestic economic problems, to attend to the North-South relations. Furthermore, the reform of the old order is bound to affect the vested interests of the developed countries, so they are often unwilling to make concessions on substantive issues, reject or perfunctory reasonable demands of the developing countries. Cancun conference last only re-affirmed the desirability and urgency of the global negotiations under the support of the United Nations, played a certain political role in global negotiations. <br> However, at the Cancun conference summit of developing countries and developed countries summit be able to sit at the same negotiating table, officially devoted to North-South relations, this is the first time in history.
