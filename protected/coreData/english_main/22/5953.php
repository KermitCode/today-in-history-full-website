'cont'=>'June 22, 1991 (, Xinwei May 11), the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin found that world-class gas field. <br> 1991, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin natural gas exploration and development major breakthrough. One of the largest world-class gas field has control in hand, show atmospheric area greater range of gas prospects in sight. This is to bring the Gospel to people in poverty-stricken areas of the Northwest, and will play an important role in the development of our national economy. Changqing Petroleum Exploration Bureau, <br> responsible for exploration and development tasks of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin atmospheric zone in Jingbian in 1990 opened up a new situation in the exploration and development of natural gas in 1991, organizations large-scale battle localities: the first five months of drilled The number of exploration wells succeeded again and again, given the yield gas flow, highest single well of a million cubic meters of gas production. <br> This shows that, along the north and south of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia central uplift the northern end of Jingbian - Yokoyama, 80 km, 40 km east and west, a total area of &#8203;&#8203;3,200 square kilometers within the block large reserves of large gas fields. Only have preliminary the 1200 km2 focus proven natural gas reserves of the region, was already very considerable, can be called world-class gas field. Moreover, the gas field is located throughout the 15,000 km2 area, the vision of the natural gas reserves show is also very gratifying, gas-bearing area is still expanding as exploration progresses. <br> large gas field exploration and development progress faster, less investment, the outcome of large gas fields evenly contiguous industrial exploitation of high-value, significant economic benefits.
