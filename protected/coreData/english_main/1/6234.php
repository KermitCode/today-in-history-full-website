'cont'=>'(Year of the OX June sixth), July 1, 1949, Mao Zedong in the \"People&#39;s Daily\" published \"On the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship\". <br> On the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship to commemorate two eighteenth anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party <br> July 1, 1949, a day, said the Communist Party of China has gone through twenty-eight years. Like a man, like his childhood, youth, middle-aged and elderly. Communist Party of China is not the children, nor is teenage young lad, but a grown up. Old people are going to die, so the party. Classes disappear, and everything as a tool of class struggle, political parties and the state apparatus, will be because of the loss of the role, there is no need to gradually wither away, the end of its historic mission, and went to the more advanced human society. Opposite us and the bourgeois parties. They are afraid to say abolish classes, the elimination of state power, and the party&#39;s eradication. We openly declare that, precisely for eradication procure these things, the creation of conditions, and work hard. The Communist Party and the state power of the dictatorship of the people, this condition. This one does not recognize the truth, it was not a Communist. Do not read just Progressive Party of Marxist-Leninist youth comrades, perhaps still do not understand this truth. They must know the truth, have a correct view of the universe. They must understand that the abolition of classes, the elimination of state power, to destroy the party, all mankind would walk this road, the only problem is the time and conditions. The worldwide communist clever than the bourgeois, they understand the law of the survival and development of things, they understand dialectics, they see far more. The bourgeois So not welcome the truth, because they do not want people to overthrow. Was overthrown, for example, in front of the Kuomintang reactionaries overthrown past Japanese imperialism and overthrown by the people of all countries, who was overthrown, this is painful, unimaginable. The working class, working people and communists, not was overthrown, but hard work and the creation of conditions of class, state power and political parties naturally attributable to the elimination of humanity into the realm of Great Harmony. Said Ching we say below, by the way of human progress vision problems here. <br> our Party through twenty-eight years, we all know, not peace through, but walked in a difficult environment, we have to combat with enemies at home and abroad within the party. Thank you, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, they gave us a weapon. This weapon is not a machine gun, but Marxism-Leninism. the <br> Lenin in 1920 ♀ leftist infantilism through the book have been written about the Russians for revolutionary theory. Russians had experienced hardships in dozens of years, and had just found Marxism. China has many things the same as before the October Revolution in Russia, or approximate. Feudal oppression, it is the same. Economic and cultural backwardness, which is approximate, the two countries are lagging behind, China is even more backward. The advanced people, in order to make the national revival, at the hard work, looking for revolutionary truth, this is the same. (Lssdjt.com) <br> time since since the Opium War of 1840, a state-of-the-art of the Chinese people, after a lot of hard work to the Western countries, the search for truth. Hong Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Yan Fu and Sun Yat-sen, on behalf of the school figures before the birth of the Communist Party of China to the West to find the truth. Time, and progress of the Chinese people, as long as it is a new doctrine in the West, what books look. Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany to send students to as many reached an alarming extent. Domestic waste imperial examination, Hing school, as if springing up efforts to learn from the West. My own youth, to learn of these things. These are the culture of the Western bourgeois democracy, the so-called new science, including the social theories and natural sciences, and the culture of Chinese feudalism that the so-called old school is antithetical. Learn the new school, in a very long period of time to produce a confidence that these very can save China, in addition to the old school, new school, said little doubt. To save the country, the only Restoration, Restoration, only to learn foreign. Only progressive Western capitalist countries, when foreign they succeeded in building a modern state of the bourgeoisie. Successful in learning Japanese to the West, the Chinese people also want to learn from the Japanese. In the eyes of Chinese people at that time, Russia is lagging behind, very few people want to learn Russian. This is from the 1840s to the early twentieth century, the Chinese people to learn foreign situation. <br> imperialist aggression to break the Chinese people&#39;s dream of learning from the West. Very strange, sir, why do you always aggression students do? Chinese people to the West to learn a good deal, but it does not work, can not always achieve the ideal. The national situation day by day or bad, environment forcing people can not live. Suspect that, growth, development. World War I shook the whole world. The Russians held the October Revolution, the creation of the world&#39;s first socialist state. Hidden underground foreigners can not see the great Russian proletariat and working people&#39;s revolutionary energy, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, like a volcano suddenly erupted, Chinese and all mankind a new light on the Russians . Then, and only then, the Chinese people from thinking to life only appeared a new period. Find the truth of Marxism-Leninism, the universally applicable to the Chinese people, has changed the face of China. <br> Chinese found Marxism introduced after the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese people not only do not know Lenin, Stalin, do not know of Marx and Engels. Salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. October Revolution helped the world to help advanced elements with the proletariat cosmology as a tool to observe the fate of the country, to re-consider their own problems. Russian way to go - this is the conclusion. In 1919, the May Fourth Movement in China. In 1921, the founding of the Communist Party of China. Sun Yat-sen encountered in despair, the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China (CPC). Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the Russians with the help of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China and his. Sun Yat-sen died, Chiang Kai-up. In twenty-two years, for a long time, Chiang Kai-shek of China until the impasse. During this period, the Soviet Union as the main force of the anti-fascist World War II to defeat the three imperialist powers, weakened the two imperialist powers, only an imperialist country in the world that the United States is no loss. Domestic crisis in the United States is a very deep one, it is to enslave the world with weapons to help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after the expulsion of Japanese imperialism, the three years of the People&#39;s Liberation War, the basic victory. That Western bourgeois civilization, bourgeois democracy and bourgeois Republic of the program, in the eyes of the Chinese people, together broken production. Bourgeois democracy gave way to the leadership of the proletariat, the Democratic People&#39;s bourgeois republic to the People&#39;s Republic. This caused a possibility: After the People&#39;s Republic of reach socialism and communism, arriving abolish classes and the world&#39;s Datong. Kang Youwei forward to the the \"the Datong book\", he did not have and can not find a way to reach common ground. The bourgeois republic and foreign countries, China can not have, because China is a country oppressed by imperialism. The only way to abolish classes and the world after the People&#39;s Republic of the leadership of the proletariat, to reach Datong. <br> have tried everything else, and have failed. People have nostalgia for something else, some go down, some awakened, some are for-brains. Incident was developed so quickly, as well as a lot of people by surprise, was to learn anew. The people of this mood is understandable, and we welcome this kind of requirement to re-learn attitude. learned after the October Revolution <br> Chinese vanguard of the proletariat, Marxism-Leninism, the establishment of the Communist Party of China. Then enter the political struggle, winding road, go twenty-eight years, had just made a basic victory. Twenty-eight years of experience as Sun Yat-sen said \"product of four decades of experience in his last will and testament, the same conclusion, namely:\" convinced me that to achieve victory, we must arouse people, and the joint world equality nations struggle together. \"Sun Yat-sen and we have each the same view of the universe, starting from a different class position to observe and deal with the problem, but in the 1920s, the question of how and imperialist struggle, but we reached this is basically consistent with the conclusions. <br> Sun Yat-sen died twenty-four years, the theory and practice of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, are forward greatly to the development of radically transform the face of China. Until now, the Chinese people have gained basic experience is that these two things: (a) in the country, to arouse the people. This is the unity of the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and thus developed to establish the leadership of the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship the country; (b) joint equality nations and all peoples on the world struggle together. This is combined with the Soviet Union, the United Nations new democratic countries, the United proletariat and the majority of the people of other countries to form an international united front. <br> \"your one-sided\". Exactly so. One-sided, Sun Yat-sen&#39;s 40 years of experience and the Communist Party 28 years of experience to teach us, well aware of the desire to win and consolidate the victory must be one-sided. Plot forty years experience of 28 years, the Chinese people, not backward side of imperialism, is the backward side of socialism, without exception. Sitting on the fence is not enough, the Third Way is not. We are opposed to the backward imperialist side of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, we are opposed to the fantasy of the Third Way. Not only China, the world, not backward imperialist is the backward socialism, no exception. The neutrality camouflage, the Third Way is not. <br> \"you too stimulating.\" We are talking about is to deal with domestic and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists and their running dogs, not to speak against any other person. For these people, the stimulus or not the problem does not occur, the stimulus is like, not stimulus but also that, because they are reactionaries. To draw the boundaries of the reactionaries and revolutionaries, to expose the machinations of the reactionaries, caused within the revolutionary vigilance and attention, and long-own ambition, and destroying the enemy&#39;s power and prestige, in order to isolate the reactionaries to win it, or replace it. Slightest timidity before a wild beast, can not be said that we have to learn on the Wu Jing Yang Gang. Seems Wu Song, Jingyang Ridge tiger, stimulate it is also that does not irritate it is also that, in short, is to eat people. Or killed by the tiger, or eaten by the tiger, it must be one. <br> \"We want to do business.\" Completely correct, always do business. We are only against domestic and foreign reactionaries impede our business, in addition to not against anyone. We must hinder our business and foreign as well as hamper the establishment of diplomatic relations between us and foreign, not someone else, it is the imperialists and their lackeys Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. Unity for all domestic and international forces break the domestic and foreign reactionaries, we have business to do, (L $ dj而.c身m) we have the possibility to establish diplomatic relations with all countries in the basis of equality and mutual benefit and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and. The (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> \"without international help for victory.\" This is the wrong idea. In the era of imperialism exists, the real people&#39;s revolution in any country, if not the assistance of the international revolutionary forces in a variety of different ways to get their own victory is impossible; victory, to consolidate, but also impossible. The great victory of the October Revolution and the consolidation, that Stalin had told us. Down with three imperialist countries in World War II and the liberation of Eastern European countries, as well. The people in China now and in the future, as well. Please think about it, if not the existence of the Soviet Union, and if there is no anti-fascist World War II victory, especially for us overthrow Japanese imperialism, if not the emergence of the new democratic countries, if there is no East, in the oppressed nation is up the struggle, not the masses of the people of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and so on within the capitalist countries and ruled the struggle between them reactionaries, if not all integrated, then piled on our heads international reactionary forces must be more than it is now I do not know a few times, in this case, we were able to victory in what? Obviously not. Victory to consolidate, it is impossible. This matter, the experience of the Chinese people is too much. When speaking of the death of Sun Yat-sen phrase joint international revolutionary forces, already reflect this kind of experience. (History today. Cn) <br> \"We need the assistance of the British and U.S. governments.\" At present, this is naive. The current ruler of the Anglo-American imperialists, they will give the people of the country to aid it? We do business with these countries as well as to assume that these countries are willing to lend to us under mutually beneficial conditions in the future, because what? This is because the capitalists of these countries to make money, the bankers want to earn interest, in order to rescue their own crisis, is not what the Chinese people&#39;s assistance. These countries, the Communist Party and progressive groups, being led to do business with us as well as the establishment of diplomatic relations. This is well-intentioned, this is aid, and the behavior of the bourgeoisie of these countries can not be compared. Sun Yat-sen&#39;s life countless times to the capitalist countries called for assistance, the results all come to nothing, but was a merciless blow. Sun Yat-sen in life, only once international assistance, this is the Soviet Union&#39;s assistance. Readers to take a look at Mr. Sun will strike, exhorting people where he&#39;s not telling people to look toward looking forward to the assistance of the imperialist countries, but called the people \"joint world equal nations\" . Mr. Sun With experience, his misfortune, when. We want to remember his words, do not be fooled. Are international anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union on the one hand the assistance of true friendship can only go to this aspect, and not to look for on the one hand to the imperialist front. <br> \"You dictatorship\". Lovely gentlemen, to tell you on exactly what we like this. Accumulated by the Chinese people in the decades of experience, call us to implement the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship, say the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship, in short, is the same, is deprived of the reactionaries say, just let the people have a say. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> people are what? In China, in the present stage, the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, these classes under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party of unite, and form their own country, to elect their own government, toward imperialism lackeys of the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class, as well as representatives of those classes Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices to exercise dictatorship, the implementation of the dictatorship, oppression of these people, and only allowed them neatly, and allowed them to utter tamper. If you want to talk nonsense to tamper with, immediately banned for sanctions. For the people, the democratic system, to be given the right to freedom of speech, assembly, association, other items. The right to vote, only to the people, not to the reactionaries. These two aspects, that is, the internal democracy of the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries, mutual combination, that is, the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship. <br> reason to do so? We are very clear. Not this revolution fails, the people would suffer, the country will perish. <br> \"You are not to destroy the state power\"? We want, but we still do not, we can not. Why? Imperialism still exists, the domestic reaction still exists, the domestic classes still exist. Our task now is to strengthen the people&#39;s state machine, mainly refers to the people&#39;s army, the police and people of the People&#39;s court, in order to protect the national defense and to protect the interests of the people, as a condition, may in the working class and the Communist Party under the leadership of steadily from an agricultural country into an industrial country by the new democratic society into a socialist society and the communist society, the abolition of classes and achieve Datong. The army, the police, the courts, other items of the state apparatus, the class of tool of class oppression. The hostile class, it is a tool of oppression, it is the violence, not the \"benevolent\" something. \"You heartless.\" Exactly so. We definitely do not apply a policy of benevolence to the reactionaries and reactionary activities of the reactionary classes. We just Shiren Zheng in the people, rather than impose on the people outside reactionaries and reactionary activities of the reactionary classes. <br> the people of the country is to protect the people. With the people of the country, the people may have in the country and the whole scale democracy educate themselves and transform themselves to disentangle itself from the impact of domestic and foreign reactionaries (which is still great, and in the long term memory in, can not be quickly destroyed), the transformation of the bad habits and bad thoughts come from the old society, not allow themselves to go into the reactionaries guidelines error on the road, and continue to move forward towards a socialist and communist society development complete the historical task of the abolition of classes and harmony. <br> method we use in this regard is the democracy that persuasion, not forced. People breaks the law should be punished, imprisoned, and the death penalty, but this is an individual situation, and reactionary class as a class dictatorship, the principle of distinction. people <br> reactionary classes and reactionaries, after their regime was overthrown, as long as they do not rebel, does not destroy, and do not make trouble, but also to work, let them live, they transform themselves in the labor, become the new . If they do not want to labor the people of the nation will be forced labor. Them to do political work, publicity and education work, and do it very carefully, very fully, as we have done the captive officers. It is also to Shiren Zheng, but we will never forgive their reactionary behavior, the likelihood of free play and never let their reactionary behavior. <br> this reactionary class transformation, the only country to do the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship. This job done, the main exploiting classes - landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class last eliminated. The rest is a national bourgeoisie, to appropriate education work among them many people at this stage. The time the socialist implement private enterprises nationalized, further their education and transformation. Powerful state machinery in the hands of the people, not afraid of the national bourgeoisie rebellion. The serious problem <br> is educating farmers. Peasant economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture based on the experience of the Soviet Union, to take a very long time and painstaking work to do. Socialization of agriculture, is no consolidation socialist. Those who wish socialization of agriculture, the development of a strong industrial state-owned enterprises as the main body. The countries of the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship, we must solve this problem step by step. This article does not intend to talk about the economic problems here temporarily unknown. in 1924, Sun Yat-sen personal guidance <br> communists to participate in the first National Congress of the Kuomintang, by a famous manifesto. The manifesto said: \"called democratic system in modern states, often bourgeois proprietary applicable oppressing the common people. Cover KMT populism of the total, compared with the general civilian non-small number of people and not privately owned. \"In addition to a question who is leading whom, as a political program point, populism here said, is consistent with the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship and we are now practiced. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s betrayal of Sun Yat-sen, took a bureaucratic dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class as a tool of oppression of Chinese civilians. This counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the implementation of the twenty-two years, until now our leadership civilians overthrown. accuse us of practicing the \"authoritarian\" or \"totalitarian\" <br> foreign reactionaries, to implement authoritarian or totalitarian people. They practice the system of the bourgeois class dictatorship of the proletariat and other people, a class of totalitarianism. Sun Yat-sen said oppressed civilians in modern states of the bourgeoisie, it is referring to these people. The counter-revolutionary dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek, is to learn from these reactionary guy. philosopher Zhu Xi, <br> Song Dynasty wrote many books, say many words, we have forgotten, but also did not forget a word: \"eye for an eye, but also a man as body. \"This is how we do, that Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries of imperialism and its lackeys Road, but also governance body of the imperialists and their lackeys Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. So much, Hath he indeed! <br> revolutionary dictatorship and dictatorship of the counter-revolutionary nature of the contrary, while the former is learned from the latter to the Learning is very important, revolutionary people, if you do not learn a treat counterrevolutionary rule, they can not remain in power, their regime will be overthrown by the domestic and foreign reactionaries, domestic and foreign reactionaries will be restored in China, the people of the revolution will suffer. of <br> people&#39;s democratic dictatorship based on the working class, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie Union, the alliance of workers and peasants, because these two classes account for eighty to ninety percent of the Chinese population . Overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the main forces of the two classes. From New Democracy to socialism, rely mainly on the alliance of the two classes. <br> people&#39;s democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class is the most visionary, selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary. The entire history of revolution proves that the leadership of the working class revolution fails, with the leadership of the working class revolution triumphs. In the era of imperialism, any other class in any country, can not lead any genuine revolution to achieve victory. Chinese national bourgeoisie has repeatedly led the revolution, have failed, is proof. <br> national bourgeoisie at this stage, is of great importance. We have imperialism standing next to this enemy is ferocious. Chinese economy to achieve real independence, but also need to go through a long period of time. Only China&#39;s industrial development, economic reliance on foreign, to be truly independent. China&#39;s modern industry is a very small proportion of the national economy as a whole. Still no reliable number of words to estimate based on certain material, modern industry, but only about 10 per cent of the total production of the National Economy. Against imperialist oppression, in order to make the the backward economic advancement step, China must make use of all beneficial to the national economy and the people&#39;s livelihood and not harmful to the urban and rural capitalist factors, unity and national bourgeoisie and the common struggle. Our approach is to abstain from capitalism rather than destroy capitalism. But the national bourgeoisie can not act as the leader of the revolution, the main status can not be accounted for in the state power. National bourgeoisie that he could not serve as the leader of the revolution, and should therefore not have a dominant position in the organs of state power, because of the socio-economic status of the national bourgeoisie provides for their weakness, their lack of vision, lack of courage, and There are many people afraid of the people. Sun Yat-sen advocated \"arouse the masses of the people, or to assist agricultural and industrial -. Who is going to \"arouse\" and \"support\" it? Sun Yat-sen mean that the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. But this is, in fact, can not be done. Four decades revolutionary Sun Yat-sen&#39;s failure, and this is what causes it? In the era of imperialism, the bourgeoisie is impossible to lead any genuine revolution to victory, the reason for this. <br> our twenty-eight years, is very different. We have a lot of valuable experience. A disciplined horse, uh, column, the Sri Lankan armed with the theory the contact masses of the people take self-criticism method. An army under the leadership of the party. A united front by the revolutionary faction of the party led the revolutionary class. The three main experience. These are distinguished from their predecessors. Relying on three basic victory. We have traveled a winding road. We have to fight opportunistic tendencies and the party, the right and left. Who committed a serious error in these three things, the revolution would be frustrated. Lessons from mistakes and setbacks, smart things a lot better. Any political party, any individual, to avoid mistakes, but we should make a little less. A mistake is made, request the correction, the more quickly and thoroughly the better. <br> summarize our experience, to this point, the working class (after the leadership of the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship - this is our formula, which is our main experience, which is our main program. <br> party 28 years is a long period of time, we only do one thing, this is the basic victory. This is cause for celebration, because it is a victory for the people, because this is a big country like China victory. Things such as walking, past work just taken the first step as the Long March. Residual enemy has yet to be wiped out. Serious economic construction task before us. We are familiar with some of the things about to idle up, something we are not familiar with is forcing us to do. This is difficult. The imperialists liquidated we do bad economy. They stood watching, waiting for our failures. <br> We must overcome the difficulties, we must learn what they do not know. We must learn to all who know people (no matter who) economic work. Worship them as teachers, school respectfully and conscientiously. Do not know just do not understand, do not pretend to understand. Do not put the bureaucratic shelf. Dig into a few months, a year, two years, three years, five years, you can always learn. The Soviet Communists nor the General Assembly at the beginning of Office of the economy, the imperialists have to wait before they fail. But CPSU is victory, not only will the revolution under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, they will be building. They have built up a great grandeur and socialist countries. Join with our best President we must to Alliance, learning. We can fully rely on the weapons of the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship and unite all the people of the country in addition to the reactionaries outside, walked steadily to the destination. <br>'
