'cont'=>'December 1, 1792 (, Yam Tze October 18), the Russian mathematician Lobachevsky was born. Nicolas, <br> <br> Ivanovic ¡¤ Lobachevsky (§¯§Ú§Ü§à§Ý§Ñ§Û §ª§Ó§Ñ§ß§à§Ó§Ú§é §­§à§Ò§Ñ§é§Ö§Ó§ã§Ü§Ú§Û, English-Nikolas lvanovich Lobachevsky) (1792, -1856 years January 24, 2008), Russian mathematician, and early detection of non-Euclidean geometry one.ÂÞ°ÍÇÐ·òË¹ based on Kazan University in 1807, in 1811 obtained a master&#39;s degree in physics and mathematics, and stayed on to work. 1814 Assistant Professor Ren, additional professor, in 1816 promoted to become a permanent professor in 1822. Lobachevsky began administrative duties from 1818 onwards, the first to be elected to the Kazan University Authority. Engineering Committee of new schools in 1822, and in 1825 was elected chairman of the committee. During this period, has also twice served as the Head of the Department of physics and mathematics (1820-1821,1823-1825). Working with distinction in 1827, the School Committee election he served as president of Kazan University. Any the Kazan school district vice inspectors after 1846, until his death. <br> Lobachevsky all prove that they can not escape the tautological error found when trying to prove the parallel axiom. So he assume that: too straight-line point, you can make numerous line known straight line parallel. If this is assumed to be negative, as evidenced by the parallel axiom. However, he not only did not deny this proposition, and use it to start with the same proposition has nothing to do with the parallel axiom in Euclidean geometry inference, a logical geometric system - non-Euclidean geometry, which Roche geometry is then people said. <br> Roche geometry founded on the development of geometry and mathematics has played a huge role, but one does not pay attention until Lobachevsky died 12 years before gradually being widely recognized. Lobachevsky certain achievements in mathematical analysis and algebra. <br> Review: Euclidean geometry did not understand, non-Euclidean geometry only reverence <br>'
