This is our leader Mao Zedong&#39;s inscription. Line amplifier brilliant gold, not the artist fashioned but all of China&#39;s Revolutionary War history condensed into. And wins from enemy aircraft, tanks, artillery, warships model imperialist modern aggression weapons on display 23 years ago since the Nanchang Uprising era save rifle, as well as the of Jinggangshan era Red Guards spear sub ?? gun, and the Young Pioneers to maintain revolutionary order stick. From the exhibition into a million pieces of the Revolutionary War historical artifacts, photographs and drawings, we see the birth of the Chinese People&#39;s Armed Forces, development, and growth, but also saw the imperialist aggression in China land fiasco process. <br> in large Takadono three court display weapons of various historical periods of the People&#39;s Liberation Army. Hanyang made \"eighty\"-style rifles and carbines, which is the typical weapon of the decade of the Agrarian Revolutionary War era. During the War of Resistance Against Japan in eight years, the typical weapons are the Japanese invaders manufacturing step of the \"38\" type carbine and light machine guns. In the past eighteen years, the People&#39;s Liberation Army only a few guns and little heavy machine guns. More soil made mines, soil guns, grenades, Hong Yingqiang elm tree trunk hollowed made the \"Elm gun\" like the original weapons. These primitive weapons, despite all the rough mixed, one thing is common: can be killed by the enemy. Even a stone or an iron pot, condensation Kills wisdom of the people. To the War of Liberation, the weapon is very different: the caliber one hundred fifty-five mm US-made howitzers, which is a United States sent to the Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s largest gun. 15 tons of US-made landing tanks, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, various chariot. ... Three hundred fourteen kinds of different exhibit, (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) most of the manufacturing of various imperialist countries since the First World War, most U.S. imperialism in Publisher of the World War II period. These weapons, designed to aggression others of Homeland decades has been the massacre of the Chinese people, immediate concern from Nanchang, Guangzhou, Jinggangshan from Hailufeng immediate concern around the kill, chasing kill, kill over the whole of China. But killed twenty-three years later, these weapons were all \"kill\" into the hands of the Chinese people. <br> seize these weapons of aggression, the Chinese people, not only played a new people&#39;s state, and played a defense of the people of the country invincible Liberation Army. This is just because criminals early twenty-three years ago, the education of the Chinese people: want peace, do not lay down their arms! <br> this is Chairman Mao instructed us: \"in China, left the armed struggle, there is no proletarian status, you do not have the status of the people, on the status of the Communist Party, it is not the victory of the revolution. \"This indicates, stands in the way leading to the afternoon gatehouse on the revolutionary war history showroom. Not far away is the one strangling the revolutionary martyrs Comrade Li Dazhao the instruments of torture. Massacre of the sins of the people of China in the showroom, first saw 23 years ago China&#39;s first war criminals track: \"Chiang Kai-shek warrant: the communist molecules upon hearing real, site Dhamma\", which is nineteen 2027 the Guangdong newspaper drip records, two hundred young people were by firing squad, the workers were massacred peasants were massacred, young people were massacred countless unarmed revolutionary people were massacred. \"But,\" what Chairman Mao said: \"The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and not be intimidated, nor exterminated. They climb up from the ground, wiped off the blood, bury the corpses of good companions, they continue to fight. \"Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, and, at the same time, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, Guangzhou Uprising, is not revolutionary people exterminated under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Zhu De, Ye Ting and He Long, continued high lift anti- Emperor banner of anti-feudal, the Chinese revolution to the new phase of the armed struggle. China is a people&#39;s regime - Hailufeng and Guangzhou people&#39;s regime. Powerful reactionaries crazy repression failed, the famous workers leader Su Zhaozheng peasant leaders Peng Pai was killed, but the people from this not to lay down their arms. Until now, we can see in the exhibition room the revolutionary people Hailufeng preserved clots of blood covered with bullet holes, to see Farmers Association membership card and the revolutionary movement of relics, including a lot of the time the photo is precious photo. We can see: how the martyrs Pengpai old mother, pointing to the first Chinese people&#39;s political power there have been places where education not exterminated offspring. Even after the failure of the Nanchang Uprising revolutionary fighters, and the late Red Army champion Fang Zhimin on the outskirts of the city adhere to the underground work of Comrade Wang Fengfei until local can not be hiding, still refuses to throw away the weapons, he let his wife a pistol uprising two rifles buried in the ground until the Nanchang liberation last year. Although The grip is already rotting best net full of rust barrel or as spineless and awe-inspiring, never tell future generations what is called \"August\" gun. Show at the exhibition Comrade Peng Pai-old mother gave the gift of the People&#39;s Liberation Army, (? V history today?? Com), she said: \"I know that the KMT kill finish the Chinese people, the people of a certain victory. I look forward to the full twenty-two years, and saw his own team back. \"Rendezvous in Jinggangshan, the earliest group of People&#39;s Liberation Army, it is such a brave and indomitable revolutionary army, which under Chairman Mao, Zhu De personally train, after a decade Agrarian Revolutionary War and eight Sino-Japanese War, once five encirclement smash Chiang Kai-shek, completed the Long March, defeated a powerful Japanese imperialism. Persevering despite over 18 years fighting are dominant at home and abroad in the number of excellent equipment surrounded by armed counter-revolutionary military offensive. <br> However, if you leave a correct military line, only the brave and tenacious and unlimited loyalty of the people or not to defeat the enemy. The dark days of the full-scale attack to the liberated areas of Chiang Kai-shek, and I&#39;ll never forget the retreat on the road to an old woman complained: \"There are two hate\" in my life, she said, \"a hate Kuomintang offensive hate the Communist Party retreat. \"Some soldiers can not endure the emotional torment, machine-gun on the ground do not go:\" You retreat! I die here should Pindiao KMT a even! \"But the Chinese people to Pindiao not a company, but the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s institutions. A time when the enemy only has 4.3 million troops, and get a $ U.S. fifty-nine absolutely military aid, only the United States armed forces there are forty five divisions. Ninety thousand U.S. Marines even with Jiang Fei alone invade through the People&#39;s Liberation Army thirty times. Not in a city, gains and losses, take the initiative to destroy the enemy&#39;s effective strength, give up over 45-city of Zhangjiakou, Yan&#39;an the unwavering military guiding principles, the people in the first year of the war of liberation. At that time the enemy proud ah! \"The three months to six months to wipe out all of the Total Army! \"In the Northeast have not met an opponent! \"Total Army thrust on Changbai Mountain eat stones! \"......
