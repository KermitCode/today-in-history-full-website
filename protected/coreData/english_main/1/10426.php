Past disarmament major downsizing, little change in the internal structure. This not only is downsizing, is to conduct a reorganization of the military system and especially the Army, a military force toward the synthetic group army special forces troops once more than the number of the first infantry.

This is two important changes. First transformation, the understanding of war and peace. Our view has always been in the past, war is inevitable and imminent. In recent years, we carefully observed the situation, that hit the World Wars, the only two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States are eligible, but two are not daring to fight. The world is big and very complicated, not much really support the war, people are demanding peace, oppose war. Would also like to see the new scientific and technological revolution in the world is booming, the economy, science and technology have become increasingly prominent position in world competition, this situation (on www.TodayOnHistory.com) the United States, the Soviet Union and other developing countries are not Do not be taken seriously. Thus, we believe that the world war will not hit in a long period, and the maintenance of world peace is hope. The second change, our foreign policy has changed. Last for a long period of time, the threat of Soviet hegemony, we engage in a \"one-line\" strategy. Now we have changed strategy. The Chinese do not fight someone else&#39;s brand, and not allow anyone to play the China card. This enhanced China&#39;s international status. Adhere to such a judgment and policy, we will be able to do a good job in our four modernizations wholeheartedly. The first economic upswing, and everything to do. Is to bite the bullet and economic upswing, so the overall situation, and all must obey this overall situation. The wise decision often <br> only after it wise. Ten years later, all Comrade Xiaoping expected, no outbreak of world wars, a force for peace is growing. What we put into a major force in economic construction, and constantly enhance the comprehensive national strength, our party, our country has withstood the test of countless stormy sea Kuiran not fall. <br>'
