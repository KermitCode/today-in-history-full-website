'title'=>'Successfully detonated the first hydrogen bomb in the United States',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'November 1, 1952 (Imjin September 14), the first U.S. hydrogen bomb explosion. <br> 1949 to September 23, 2011, the Soviet government announced the successful explosion of the first atomic bomb, thus breaking the nuclear monopoly of the United States, a big shock to the American government and U.S. Air Force thought the Soviet Union only to 1952 years to have produced the first atomic bomb. The American scientist Taylor (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> think this is an excellent opportunity to mobilize government to manufacture hydrogen bombs, his first in California to find like-minded Lawrence - Berkeley Radiation Laboratory chemist Latimer and later Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez (they all participated in the Manhattan Project&#39;s work), the party on October 6, 1949, in Los Alamos, and detailed discussion of the problem of the hydrogen bomb manufacturing, full estimated the difficulties caused by a few key questions to the hydrogen bomb manufacturing. First, the new equation using conventional methods simply do not count. Make accurate calculation of the alarming number of complex hydrogen bomb device every step should be to determine the impact of small parts within its bombs to millions, but difficult to cope with the human brain. Second, the need to have several million degree heat to detonate the hydrogen bomb, to invest in the kind of atomic bomb of Hiroshima NA, need to create a specialized atomic bomb as detonators, this is bound to affect the production capacity of the U.S. atomic bomb. Third, the hydrogen bomb really explosive hydrogen and hydrogen isotopes of neon, neon does not exist in nature, and decays rapidly. Only in a specially designed heavy water reactor, uranium and neutron nuclear reaction to produce neon. Hydrogen and neon is a gas at room temperature, however, detonated before, must be kept near absolute zero, minus 273 degrees that Celsius, hence the need for a large refrigeration equipment. <br> they decided to look for the supporters of the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, they found a strong supporter of the United States Naval Reserve Rear Admiral Lewis Strauss, the Atomic Energy Commission of five members in one (the remaining four are opposed). They are still fighting to change the views of others. As chairman of the congressional Joint Committee of Atomic Energy, Senator McMahon, director of the policy planning office of the State Council, Paul Nitze, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Omar Bradley. Taylor insisted that the prestige of the United States depends on the technical superiority of the United States, the Soviet Union, who made the first one fusion bomb, the United States will lose face. Lobbying Taylor be found in the political and military supporters. January 13, 1950, on behalf of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Omar Bradley, proposes to manufacture a hydrogen bomb. This month, the infamous McCarthyism came out. The fourth day after the decision in Bradley, came from the United Kingdom is conducive to the message of the hydrogen bomb maker, the British nuclear scientist Fuchs directed with treason on the grounds that he sold nuclear technology to the Soviet Union. This event means that the Soviet Union will compete with the United States, which has further strengthened the determination of the U.S. government to manufacture hydrogen bombs. January 31 by Secretary of State Dean Acheson, Secretary of Defense Johnson and the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lilienthal was composed of a three-person Special Ad Hoc Committee to study whether to manufacture hydrogen bombs. Vote against the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb Lilienthal was defeated. On the afternoon of the same day, President Truman announced the decision to manufacture hydrogen bombs. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> Truman&#39;s decision scientists strongly opposed to being the center of the three giants of the American scientific community - Einstein, Oppenheimer and Harvard University president James Conant Federation of American Scientists criticized the government on the surface to seek peace with easing is actually dependent on the destructive power of the bomb. Under the leadership of the Cornell University Hans Betti, 12 senior U.S. physicist published a call for the book, said: \"We believe that regardless of a country&#39;s legitimate reason, it has the right to use this kinds of bombs. Such bombs have been non-use of a weapon in the war, but the extinction of the entire human means. \"Einstein circulated a remarkable statement, that the hydrogen bomb could destroy all life in one fell swoop, because of its radioactive this great man that the\" full-scale armed military security thinking in the the war existing technology level is It is a sad fantasy. \"He felt that the arms race has reached a hysterical level. Oppenheimer and Conant requirements to resign as president of the duties of the Advisory Board, Einstein, Oppenheimer opposed to manufacturing a hydrogen bomb, later was actually the U.S. government&#39;s political persecution. strong opposition <br> atomic scientists, and did not prevent the U.S. government continues to manufacture hydrogen bombs, as time goes on, the difficulties of manufacturing technology also eleven breakthrough, the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, many held opposed U.S. scientists turn to participate in the development of the hydrogen bomb. In this way, the development process is accelerated, First, the establishment of a large number of heavy-water reactor, they are not only able to produce the plutonium needed by ordinary atomic bomb, but also be able to produce the hydrogen bomb neon. Past atomic bomb made significant improvements, the development of a new type of atomic bomb detonated hydrogen. In the spring of 1951, John von Neumann, a computer expert, the successful development of a new type of high-speed electronic digital computer \"to solve the the special mathematical problem of thermonuclear bombs. Also at this time, Sri Lanka, but ﹞ Wu Lanmu and Taylor to solve the problem of the hydrogen bomb detonated. In May of this year, the United States created the atomic bomb for the ignition of the hydrogen bomb. In, November <br> 1952 explosion successfully tested for the first time in the Pacific Marshall Islands 除竅裔嶺票 island. The test of a hydrogen bomb by the United States in November 1952, is a liquid heavy hydrogen and triple hydrogen temperature and type of fuel. This hydrogen bomb bulky and difficult practical Later, a \"dry\" hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos, was successfully developed. March 1, 1954, completed Gini island in the Pacific tests are successful, it is the power of the equivalent of one thousand five hundred tons of TNT gunpowder, which is invested in the power of the Hiroshima bomb 750 times. Outside of uranium in the explosion when the hydrogen bomb outside covered uranium absorbs neutrons split into fallout - \"ashes\", it may be flying to 200 km away to endanger human life. Batch victim of the hydrogen bomb and the Japanese, was 200 kilometers away from the center of the explosion, a Japanese fishing boat named \"Lucky Dragon\" is operating, due to the harm of the radioactive dust pollution, the 23 people on board home after which one person was killed, and the rest become disabled. <br> Eisenhower in January 1953, promised to use strategic weapons, \"the glorious end of the Korean War\" check in return for votes, when the President of the United States. After he took office, the intensified implementation of the former president&#39;s national defense policy and strategic approach to the spring of 1954, the United States three times in a row successfully exploded in solid neon potassium hydrogen bomb fusion materials. This series of explosions, Taylor became a smash hit characters. This is located in the nuclear scientist was born in Budapest in 1908, and thus was known as the \"father of the hydrogen bomb.
