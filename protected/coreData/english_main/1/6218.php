'cont'=>'(On May 19 BingXu), July 1, 1646, German scientist, Leibniz was born. <br> <br> great philosopher, the great scientist Gottfried Wilhelm &#8226; Where &#8226; Leibniz (Gottfriend Wilhelm von Leibniz). the <br> a figure <br> Gottfried Wilhelm &#8226; Where &#8226; Leibniz (Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, 1646 Nian July 1, 2011 ~ 1716 November 14 days), Germany&#39;s most natural scientists, mathematicians, physicists, historians and philosophers, a world-rare scientific genius, and Newton (1643 -1727 years) with the calculus of founder. He read, studied under Wikipedia, has made an indelible contribution to the rich treasure house of scientific knowledge of the human. The the <br> biographical and deeds <br> year July 1, 1646, Gottfried Wilhelm &#8226; Where &#8226; Leibniz was born in Leipzig in eastern Germany, a scholarly family, father Eph Lide Xi &#8226; Leibniz was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Leipzig, mother Katharina Shi Make teach family background, (TodayinHistory.cn) devout Lutheran. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> Leibniz&#39;s parents personally do the children of the Enlightenment teachers, monasteries Leibniz childhood very studious, and high talent early age of poetry and history, has a strong interest. Unfortunately, his father died he was 6 years old, but left him with a rich collection of books. Leibniz&#39;s father (lssjt.cn) <br> assume he was only six years old when they died, and left him with a rich collection of books is more valuable than money, the notice of management mother of his son&#39;s childhood education . Leibniz was able to have extensive contacts with the ancient Greek and Roman culture, and read the writings of many well-known scholars, and get a solid grounding in the culture and clear academic goals. <br> 8 years old, Leibniz entered the Nicholas School, learning Latin, Greek, repair of Ci, arithmetic, logic, music, as well as the Bible, the Lutheran doctrine. the <br> 1661 years, the 15-year-old Leibniz entered the University of Leipzig to study law, entered the school will keep up with the sophomore humanities course, seize the time to study philosophy and science. In May 1663, he was a bachelor&#39;s degree. \"On the individual principles metaphysical controversy\" During this period, Leibniz also widely read works of Bacon, Kepler, Galileo and others, and in-depth thinking and evaluation of their writings. Listened professor taught Euclid&#39;s \"Elements\" courses, Leibniz had a keen interest in mathematics. In <br> 1664, Leibniz completed the paper \"On the Law of the tough\" received a Master of Philosophy degree. February 12 is the year, his mother died. The 18-year-old Leibniz from one person alone life - born in thinking, character deeply influenced by his mother. the <br> 1665 years, Leibniz submitted to the University of Leipzig doctoral dissertation, \"On the status of\" In 1666, the Review Committee he was too young (only 20 years old) and refused to grant his Juris Doctor, Hegel thinks This may Leibniz philosophical insights too, review papers professors see him vigorously study philosophy, and my heart is very happy. Which he is very angry, and so decided to leave Leipzig, go to the University of Altdorf near Nuremberg, and immediately had prepared article doctoral thesis submitted to the school, in February 1667, the University of Altdorf awarded him the Doctor of Laws degree, also hired him as Professor of Law. <br> this year, Leibniz published his first mathematical papers \"On combinations art\". This is an article on mathematical logic, the basic idea is to want the truth of the theory argument due to the results of a calculation. Of this paper is not mature enough, but it shines with innovative wisdom and talent in mathematics, a series of work later he became the founder of mathematical logic. <br> 1666, Leibniz Juris Doctor in Nuremberg alchemist groups, 1667, by the group to get to know the politicians Boyne Castle Baron John Kerry Steven and recommended by Baron to the Elector Mai Yinci from Leibniz boarded the political arena, they join the diplomatic community, in Mainz the Archbishop Sheenboen the men work. By <br> 167l to the winter of 1672, he by Mai Yinci Elector entrusted preparing to stop the plans of the French attack Germany. 1672, Leibniz as a diplomat, ambassador in Paris, trying to persuade King Louis XIV of France to give up the attack, they did not manage to His Holiness meet, let alone complete Elector task entrusted to him . This diplomatic campaign ended in failure, During this time, however, he was deeply inspired by Huygens, determination to study higher mathematics, and studied Descartes, Fermat, [lssdjt.cn] Pascal and other writings, start the creative work. 1 <br> 1673, in order to promote reconciliation between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, he went to London to pursue good offices unsuccessful. He has to take advantage of this opportunity to contact with the well-known scholar of British academia. He met with which communication up to three years, the Secretary of the Royal Society, mathematician Aodeng Bo and physicist Hooker, chemists Boyle et al. Leibniz returned to Paris in March 1673, shall be recommended as a member of the Royal Society in April. During this period, his growing interest apparent in math and science. (? V history today?? Com) In October 1672, Mai Yinci Elector died, the Leibniz lost jobs and salaries, while only a tutor. At that time, he had parties seeking the official position of the diplomats, or to seek a post in the French Academy of Sciences, have not been successful. Had no option but to accept the invitation of of Hannover Duke Johann Friedrich, Hanover. <br> 1676, Leibniz left Paris, he first made a brief stopover in London. Then to the Netherlands, met for the first time observed using a microscope Leeuwenhoek, bacteria, protozoa and sperm biologist, had an impact on these later Leibniz philosophy. In The Hague, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) he saw Spinoza. In January 1677, Leibniz arrived in Hanover, as the Duke of Brunswick House Counsel and Librarian and Brunswick family history of official and responsible for international communications and act as a technical advisor. Hanover became his permanent residence. [Lssjt.cn] <br> in busy public Leibniz extensively studied philosophy and a variety of scientific, technical issues, and engage in a wide range of academic and cultural and socio-political activities. Soon, he became a court members, community, prominent life which wealthy. In 1682, the the Leibniz door grams founder of the history of modern science Zhuo influential the Latin scientific journal \"Academic Chronicle (also known as\" teachers of \"), most of his mathematics, philosophy articles published in the magazine; This , his philosophy has gradually matured. <br> 1679, the Duke of Brunswick, John &#8226; Freed actually the sudden death of his brother Auguste successor knighthood, Leibniz retains the original post. The new Duchess Sophie is an admirer of his philosophical doctrines, \"no two identical leaves in the world, the famous saying, it comes from his conversation with Sophie. <br> August in order to achieve the ambition to succeed him in the whole of Germany, suggested that Leibniz widely historical research and surveys, writing a book about the modern history of their family. In 1686, he began the work. The local valuable archival material, he requests a widely traveled in Europe. In November, <br> 1687 Leibniz left Hanover, in early 1688, summer arrived in Vienna in May. In addition to searching for files, a lot of time to get to know scholars and celebrities. In Vienna, he met the Austrian Emperor Leopold I, emperor structure to draw a series of economic, scientific planning, the Emperor was impressed. He tried to seek a position in Austria palace, but it was not until 1713 before they get a positive reply, [? V history today?? Com] he requested ancient Austria to build a \"world library\" program has not been able to achieve. Subsequently, he went to Venice, and then arrived in Rome. In Rome, he was elected to the Academy of Science of Science and Mathematics in Rome. In 1690, Leibniz returned to Hanover. Writing Brunswick family history of achievements, he received the the senator consultants official duties. <br> in 1700 century transition period, Leibniz enthusiastically engaged in the planning, construction of affairs of the Academy of Sciences. He felt that independent scholars engaged in the national construction of a waste of time and with little success, so trying to promote the concentration of talent in academic, cultural and engineering, in order to better arrange social production, guidance. <br> since 1695, Leibniz has been for the establishment of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin running around everywhere lobbying. In 1698, for which he personally went to Berlin. 1700, when his second visit to Berlin, and finally got the Friedrich I, especially his wife (Hanover Auguste, daughter of the Duke) sponsored the establishment of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, he served as the first President. In February 1700, he was also elected to the French Academy of Sciences. At this point, when the world&#39;s four Academy of Sciences: the Royal Society, the French Academy of the Rome Science and Mathematical Sciences, Berlin Academy Lai Buni times as core members. In early <br> 1713, Vienna emperor granted Leibniz Empire consultant posts, inviting him to guide the establishment of the Academy of Sciences. Peter the Great of Russia also 17ll ~ 1716 years to travel to Europe to visit a few times to listen to the recommendations of Leibniz. Leibniz tried to make this such thing as the emperor believe the establishment of an Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg is valuable. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) Peter the Great, very interested in, in 1712, he gave Leibniz a salary mathematics, science court adviser&#39;s duties. Around 1712, he simultaneously dimension cashier, Brunswick, Berlin, St. Petersburg and other royal family employed. During this period, he actively encouraged him to write the encyclopedia, the establishment of the Academy of Sciences, and the use of technology to transform society plans. After his death, the Vienna Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences has set up. According to legend, he also used by missionaries, it is recommended that the Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty of China Academy of Sciences in Beijing to establish. each court favor <br> much in Leibniz, he already started toward the miserable old age. Year November 14, 1716, due to the the gallstones cause of colic stay in bed for a week after Leibniz solitude left dead, aged 70 years old. <br> Leibniz&#39;s life was not married, not a professor at the University. He usually never entered the church, he had a nickname Lovenix that do not believe. Priest when he died this as an excuse to ignore, had hired had his court does not say, no one came to offer condolences. His deathbed, his only companionship he trusted the doctor and his secretary Eckhart. Eckhart issue obituary, secretary of the French Academy of Sciences closure Deng Naer to Leibniz, the foreign members in the Academy of the regular meeting delivered a eulogy. 1793, Hanover human he built a monument; 1883, his one vertical statue erected near a church in Leipzig; 1983, the the Hanover municipal government as it rebuilt was destroyed in the Second World War the & ldquo ; Leibniz House, for people to pay their last respects. <br> personal achievement <br> Pioneer the calculus <br> 17 half of the century, the rapid development of science and technology in Europe, due to the improvement of productivity and social aspects of an urgent need, through the efforts of scientists from various countries and history accumulation, the establishment on the basis of the concept of function and limiting calculus theory emerged. <br> Calculus thinking can be traced back to Greece proposed by Archimedes et al, calculate the area and volume. In 1665 Newton founding calculus, Leibniz published between 1673-1676 the Calculus thought treatise. <br> ago, differential and integral as two math, two types of mathematical problems, were to be studied. Cavalieri, Barrow, Wallis et al quadrature (integration), find the slope of the tangent (derivative) important results, but these results are isolated, incoherent. <br> Leibniz and Newton, Integral, and Derivative real communication up to find two operations: the internal direct link between the differential and integral reciprocal. And this is a key created by the calculus. Only the basic relationship is established, to build a system based on calculus. And from differential quadrature formula for a variety of functions, summed up a common algorithm, so the universalization of the calculus, calculus algorithm developed into a symbol. Therefore, the calculus \"substantially completed by Newton and Leibniz, but not invented by them. (History com) <br> however calculus founded priority in the history of mathematics, has set off a fierce debate. In fact, Newton&#39;s calculus earlier than Leibniz, but the outcome of Leibniz published earlier than Newton. October 1684 <br> Leibniz published papers on the \"teachers of a demand minimax wonderful type of calculation is the first calculus literature. This only six papers, the content is not rich, the reasoning is quite vague, but it has epoch-making significance. Newton in the three years after the first edition of the \"mathematical principles of natural philosophy\" that was published in 1687 and the second edition also wrote: \"Ten years ago, I and most eminent geometer Leibniz Nitz communication, I show that I already know the method to determine the maximum and the minimum values &#8203;&#8203;of the tangent method and similar methods, but I&#39;m in the exchange of letters concealed ...... The most The outstanding scientists wrote in reply, he also found a similar way. And v. state of his method, and my method is almost no different, in addition to his wording and symbols inside out \"(when reprinted in the third edition and later, these words are deleted). <br> Therefore, later recognized as Newton and Leibniz independently created calculus. <br> Newton from physics, the use of the collection method of calculus and its application on the combined kinematics attainments than Leibniz. Leibniz from geometric problems starting use analytics to introduce the concept of calculus derived algorithms, mathematical rigor and systematic than Newton. <br> Leibniz recognize the good mathematical symbols can save the labor of thinking, the use of symbols of skills is one of the key to the success of mathematics. Therefore, the symbol of the creation of the calculus is far better than Newton&#39;s symbol, and this has significant implications for the development of the calculus. In 1713, Leibniz calculus, history and origin, \"summed up their own ideas to the creation of calculus, and illustrate their achievement of independence. the <br> gossip radius of Figure with binary <br> of Leibniz&#39;s binary gossip map, there is a lot of research, but invented by Leibniz Bagua map binary or separate invention binary, and so far seems to be inconclusive. Hu Yang, Li Changhe Tudor writings Leibniz - binary and gossip map test \"credible material that Leibniz binary at least in part by the Eight Diagrams inspired. <br> according to Leibniz, 1679 years ago, invented the binary arithmetic before April 1, 1703, but received the jesuit Bouvet Send gossip diagram, then he began formal study of gossip symbols and discovered binary system map gossip consistency. A few days later, he wrote a thesis \"binary arithmetic exposition - the only 0 and 1 Also on the significance of the figures used in its usefulness and Fuxi, published in the French Royal Academy of Sciences\". The many researchers Leibniz, Leibniz is not a According to gossip diagram inspired invention binary. <br> Hu Yang, Li Changhe Tudor writings Leibniz - binary and gossip map test \"to prove the Leibniz 1703 saw Bouvet bring his gossip diagram, but does not mean that this is his first time to see the gossip, but as early as 1687, Leibniz had seen gossip Fig. the <br> 1687 years, Jesus will Shibo should reason published a book of the Chinese philosopher Confucius \", in which a total of 13 pairs the gossip diagram introduced the book with gossip sequence diagram, gossip orientation diagram and King Wen hexagrams Fig. It is worth mentioning that the gossip sequence diagram the orientation diagram gossip and King Wen hexagrams figure, (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) in the corresponding Guaxiang, marked with Arabic numerals 1-64. <br> Leibniz binary 0 and 1 extended, it can be said that all the numbers, such as 000,001,010,011,100 represent 0-4 few figures. Can be expressed in the I Ching gossip, extended through the yin and yang, and some principles of the universe. Yin Yao regarded as 0, Yang Yao as a the all Guaxiang Therefore, they can be seen as a combination of 0 and 1. Such as Kun is 000000, Qian is 111111, the great Gua is 111101, and so on. The Fuxi sixty-four Guaxiang also happens can be seen as the binary arithmetic figures from 0-63. <br> Leibniz published in the Chinese philosopher Confucius year, read this book. Letter to friends von Hessen - Rhine Fil, read this book, he said. In this letter, the words \"Fohi\", translated into Chinese the word \"Fuxi\". Here are some facts, it is not difficult to prove, Leibniz was seen gossip sequence diagram, the orientation diagram gossip and King Wen hexagrams Figure. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> Leibniz claimed in a letter of May 17, 1698, for the binary thinking 20 years. May 18, 1703 Back Bouvet letter also said that twenty years ago, he invented the binary. (History TodayOnHistory.com) 1679 binary mathematics museum. Under this situation, the Bo reasons, \"a book of the Chinese philosopher Confucius easy map content, should he invented the binary has no effect. <br> Hu Yang, Li Changhe Tudor writings Leibniz - binary and gossip map test \"material that, as early as in 1679, that is, he invented the binary earliest time before Europe there on the Bagua map book publishing, but easy to figure Leibniz also seen before 1679. <br> Hu Yang, Li Changhe Tudor writings Leibniz?? binary map test and gossip \"introduced scholars Sibiseer Chinese cultural and historical analysis,\" a book published in the Netherlands in 1660, and recorded in the book I Ging (Book of Changes). Sibisaier very close contacts with Leibniz, and this book is a book Leibniz reference to understand China.

The book details the Taiji Bagua evolution of yin and yang two appearances astrotech, born four images, four images and raw gossip. Some scholars believe that the \"Ancient History\" may first introduced to Europe. Hexagrams and influence of Leibniz. Leibniz in, the many accomplishments <br> the <br> higher mathematics, mathematics achievement, his research and findings penetrated into many areas of higher mathematics. His series of important mathematical theory put forward, and laid the foundation for later mathematical theory. <br> Leibniz had discussed the negative and complex nature of the logarithm does not come to the plural, conjugate complex and the real number of conclusions. In a later study, Leibniz own conclusion is correct. He also conducted a study of linear equations, elimination method theoretically discussed, and first introduced the concept of determinant proposed determinant theory, Leibniz founded symbolic logic the basic concepts. Computer Science (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> contribution <br> 1673 Leibniz specially to Paris to manufacture an add, subtract, multiply, divide and square root operation computer. The Following Paz Calgary Act machines, another progress calculation tool. After the death of Pascal, Leibniz discovered a the adder paper wrote by Pascal, evoke his strong desire for invention, this machine&#39;s functions were determined to expand the multiplication and division. Leibniz&#39;s early experienced frustrations. Time ambassador to France, to create an opportunity to achieve the long-cherished wish of manufacturing computer. Leibniz hired some famous mechanical work of experts and craftsmen to assist in Paris, and finally in 1674 to create a better mechanical computer. Leibniz invented a machine called the \"multiplier\", about 1 meter long, the internally mounted a series of gear mechanism, in addition to the large size, the basic principle of inheritance in Pascal. However, Leibniz for the computer to add a device called \"stepping round. Stepping wheel is a long cylinder of the nine teeth, nine teeth sequentially located in the cylindrical surface; next otherwise pinions can be moved axially, in order to successive engagement with the stepper wheel. Whenever the pinion gear rotation, stepper wheel in accordance with the number of teeth of meshing with the pinion gear, respectively, rotated by 1/10, 2/10 ring ...... until the 9/10 turns, so that it can be continuously repeatedly doing addition and subtraction, in the process of rotation of the handle, so that this repeated subtraction for multiplication and division. <br> Leibniz contribution to the computer not only because the multiplier of Leibniz a friend gave him China&#39;s \"easy\" (gossip) about the year 1700, be inspired final enlightenment the true meaning of a binary number. Leibniz multiplier still decimal, but he took the lead for the design of the computer, the system proposed binary algorithm, has laid a solid foundation for the development of the modern computer. fruitful <br> physics achievements <br> Leibniz physics achievement is extraordinary. 1671 Leibniz published a new physics hypothesis, specific movement principle and the principle of abstract movement, moving objects, no matter how small, it will take the part of the object in a completely still state movement. He also seriously discussed the principle of conservation of momentum Descartes proposed, the prototype of the principle of conservation of energy, and published in the \"teachers of natural law,\" Descartes and others significant error short proof, raised the issue of the amount of movement, to prove that the momentum can not be used as the unit of measure of the movement, and the introduction of the kinetic energy concept, the first time that the kinetic energy conservation is an ordinary physical principles. <br> he fully demonstrated the \"perpetual motion machine is impossible to view. He also opposed Newton&#39;s absolute time and space, that \"no substance, there is no space, space itself is not absolute reality,\" the difference between space and material as the difference between time and movement, but although these things difference, but it can not be separated. \" This idea later aroused the attention of Mach, Einstein and others. <br> 1684, Leibniz article in the \"new solid force analysis demonstrates that fiber can extend its tension and elongation is proportional to, so he made the Hooke&#39;s law applied to individual fibers. [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] This hypothesis was later known as the Marriott - Leibniz theory in material mechanics. <br> in optics, Leibniz also accomplish something in his calculus for extreme derive the law of refraction, and try using the the extremum method explained optical fundamental laws. It can be said the Leibniz physics research has been progress toward the goal to establish a similar system of Euclidean geometry axioms for physics. The writings of <br> Monadologie <br> Germany Modern philosopher GW Leibniz, the <br> philosophy contribution monadism <br> monadism in. The original French monadism the title. In 1720, Koehler has published this German translation, 1721 Ditang According to the German translation translated into Latin, the 1840 JE Ireland Terman Leibniz manuscripts found the original income edited \"Lai Buni Zizhe school Complete Works \", and together with the title. This article is Leibniz main ideas expounded by many philosophical works highly concentrated work. Space is short, but rich in content. 90 The full text can be roughly divided into two parts: 1 to 48 mainly discusses the nature of all entities, including entities should constitute the last unit of the complex itself is not part of the simple things, that the spirit of the list; entity itself should have the intrinsic active principles. 49 to 90 mainly discusses the relationship between the entities, including before the scheduled harmonious and the world is \"all the best in the world possible world\" doctrine. Leibniz&#39;s monad on a system of objective idealism, there is a tendency to compromise religious theology, but it also contains some rational dialectics factors, such as the thought of everything their own movement. The epistemology the epistemology of <br> Leibniz <br> Leibniz, is the same strain with his monadism to. His grades from the list belittle perceptual elevation rational, perceptual seen as a purely animal awareness. For this reason, he was opposed to empiricism, especially Locke&#39;s empiricism. His human intellect new &#39;book is written specifically to oppose Locke \"human intellect&#39;. He empiricism caught only individual things, can not grasp the universal inevitability of things. If only experience, which is the animal behavior. He said: \"beasts purely empirically, just by example to guide their own. \"Beasts Lenovo pure and simple empiricist Lenovo, they thought who previously happened in future so that they think will happen next similar occasion, and can not judge the same reason still effective. Is so easy to capture the beast, pure empiricism is so easy to make mistakes, and this is the sake. Leibniz from the universal necessity of scientific knowledge and the distinction between individual sensory experience accidental point made criticism of empiricism, this critique is profound. <br> as a rationalist, Leibniz attempted to reconcile empiricism and rationalism in an attempt to find a way between the middle road between the theory of Descartes and Locke. Detailed analysis of Locke&#39;s empiricism, he wrote: \"I have always been and still is in favor of Descartes President had advocated for innate ideas of God, and therefore also think that there are some other not from the feeling of innate ideas &#39;s. I brought this new system go further; I even think that all the thinking and behavior of our soul from its own internal, and not by feeling to give it. Leibniz inherited Cartesian rationalism advocated the theory of innate ideas. In his view, the list is no \"window\" available to the outside world and out of things, can not accept any foreign things, therefore, the understanding will be impossible to have any objective source, but only talent. However, Leibniz not in favor of the human mind advocated by Descartes born with innate ideas clearly understand. He said: \"We can not imagine that the soul, we can be like reading an open book to read about the eternal law of reason, just as the judge read the decree on the bulletin board as without difficulty, without using explore . \"In his view, the concept of talent is not always from the beginning clear (except God), but gradually developed from more obscure talent perception. Concepts and truth as tendency, endowments, habits or potential natural ability and talent in our hearts, and not as a realistic role and talent in our hearts. \"Visible, Leibniz publicity Innate Ideas, emphasizing the talent of the concept of\" potential \"sex. He described how the potential things into the reality of things, emphasized the role of sensory experience. He said: \"As long as the opportunity provided by the seat of your pants, focus on foot rule can be found in our hearts. \"Visible Leibniz does not deny the feeling to play a role in the understanding of the process. However, Leibniz that the emotional experience of individual things, while necessary, but they can only give us some special individual examples, it is impossible to provide a universal truth. He hinted: Since the universality of the inevitability of knowledge does not come from sensory experience, it can only be a psychic innate. Locke pursuing a \"Where in the intellect, and both of materialism in the sense that\" the principle of empiricism, he asserted, our knowledge is the basis of experience, our mind is something like a whiteboard, the experience can be written in it on their own symbols. Leibniz essence of mind is active in the human intellect in the new theory \", therefore, he made a supplement to the principles of Locke, that is all in the mind, and both first existing feeling except only reason itself. \" He believes that the soul since it is dynamic, it will not be the whiteboard. He marble texture compared to a human mind. Marble on the lines is not a ready-made image, but decided it suitable for what image carved into marble existing lines. \"If the stone had some lines that carved Hull Kule like than engraved else like better, the stone will be more decided to used to carved the like, and Hull Kule like It can be said, in some fashion talent in stone. \"Can be seen, on the one hand, Leibniz and Descartes advocated the theory of innate ideas; On the other hand, he and Descartes and differences between them, that the concept is potentially gifted, that concept is beginning the hearts lurks not clear perception, rational processing pondering to become clear concept. Leibniz stated awareness is a process of development of this valuable dialectic thinking, his rationalism is the only concession to the empiricism theory. <br> subject is about understanding the problem of material or spiritual entities, Leibniz against Locke&#39;s view of God may give substance to the ideological force. He believes that the spirituality of the list is the only entity, there is no material substance, raising the main natural can not be a material entity. He said: \"a feeling or thought things could not mechanical things. \"Substance capable of feeling and thinking, is not a natural thing, which they are able to so, no more than two ways, one way to God it another naturally thinking entity is linked to another The way to God miracle mind on the substance. \"<br> Outlook of Truth, Leibniz think there are two truths:\" reasoning Truth \"and\" the truth of the facts. Determining the difference between the two, he described their principles. A contradiction principle, Because of this principle, we hide contradictory things is a fallacy, as opposed to something with the fallacy is real. His in human intellect new &#39;, a more detailed description of contradiction principle: any judgment either real or fallacious. This includes two real judgment: (1) a judgment is impossible to be both true at the same time is a fallacy; 2 a judgment impossible neither is real and not a fallacy. Therefore, he said: \"The truth of the reasoning is inevitable, and their opposite is impossible. For example, according to the knowledge of the mathematical axioms, logical rules to deduce that reasoning truth, such truth is necessarily reliable. Because of this principle, the principle of sufficient reason, we can see that any phenomena can not be real or realistic, any assertion can not be just - because there is no adequate justification why things are this instead of that. He said: \"Any one thing While these reasons are often not always for us to know if it is true or indeed, if any statement is true, it must have a sufficient reason why so without as . \"Thus\" the truth of the fact is accidental, their opposite is possible. He believes that sense perception is \"the fact that the truth, such truth is accidental, not credible. He wrote: \"The original proof only of the inevitable truth from reason, and other truths from the observation of the experience or feeling. Our mind is able to recognize two truths, but it is the first source of truth; For a universal truth about how much special experience, if you do not rely on rational knowledge of its inevitability, rely summarized forever it will not get the exact guarantee. \"Visible, Leibniz advocated rationalism View of Truth, that the truth of the reasoning in the mind of its source of, rather than an accurate reflection of the objective things. Leibniz, understanding of the practical things, because human beings can not find ultimately that is sufficient reason, and thus these things, and are consistent with their truth by accident. Leibniz emphasized the \"duality\" is only we humans, because humans can not find the fact that the truth of reality sufficient reason; God, all truths are intuitive reasoning truth there is no difference between the truth of the facts, because the world and its principles are created by God, God can see everything. <br> short, Leibniz raise the truths of reasoning, showed the tendency of rationalism, but he acknowledged the truth of the facts, after all, and that it is provided by sense perception, reflects his experience on concessions. (History today. Cn) <br> However, Leibniz, \"the truth of the facts does not mean that an objective fact. In his view, list the sum of everything, but in addition to God is absolutely clear and lucid perception, many list only unconscious perception, Leibniz called the list of \"negative activities. He believes that the substance or object is the combination of these list. Substances, objects that are not there, they are just some vague, unconscious perception, but the phenomenon only. However, these phenomena should obey the law. These laws are not the laws of material nature, but the list of appearances law, they are the highest of the list - God together purpose arrangements. In this way, the teleological above mechanistic explanation of nature. Leibniz <br> versatile struggle <br> Leibniz main goal is to find a universal method of access to knowledge and inventions, such efforts lead to the discovery of many mathematics. Leibniz versatility in the history of few and he compared his field of study and its results over the mathematics, physics, mechanics, logic, biology, chemistry, geography, anatomy, zoology, in botany, gas, marine science, geology, linguistics, law, philosophy, history and diplomacy. the <br> 1693 years, Leibniz published an article about the origin of the earth, and later expanded into a book of the original Earth, Earth igneous, sedimentary rock formation reasons. For fossils in the strata that these fossils reflect the continuous development of the biological species, the ultimate cause of this phenomenon is the changes in nature, rather than accidental miracles. The Earth causes doctrine, especially the idea of &#8203;&#8203;his cosmic evolution and the evolution of the earth, inspired by Lamarck, Ryle, to some extent, to promote the progress of the 19th century theory of geology. <br> 1677, he wrote the phosphorus found history, discussed the elements of nature and extraction of phosphorus. He also raised the the separation chemicals and water desalination technology. the <br> in biology, Leibniz 1714 monadism \"writings, from a philosophical point of view the various viewpoints of the organic theory.
