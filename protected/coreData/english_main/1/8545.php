'cont'=>'September 1, 1983, July 24) (Guihai years, South Korean airliner by the Soviet missile hit the mystery to be solved. <br> families of the victims in grief mourning <br> 1983, Korean Air 007 airliner shot down by the Soviet Air Force missile. <br> According to the June 15, 1993, the South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that the cause of the incident have been identified. International Civil Aviation Organization 139 Council held in Montreal, Canada on June 14, 1993, the final investigation report released a Korean Air 007 aircraft out of route reasons. The report analyzes found that 007 aircraft did not take advantage of the inertial navigation system, flight fixed at 245 degrees flight, causing a departure from the original route, but to use a compass. The aircraft in the Sakhalin island empty, the former Soviet Air Force missile shot down. All 269 passengers and crew on board were killed. The spokesman also said that the International Civil Aviation Organization by the investigation of the incident, reaffirmed the basic principles of international law prohibiting the use of weapons against civil aircraft. August 19, 1993, the South Korean government to the Russian government by the Russian Embassy in the ROK transmitted a letter including the request for compensation for loss of life and property caused by the Russian government of 10 years ago, Soviet fighters shot down a South Korean airliner. This is the South Korean government for the first time to the Russian government formally present a claim in relation to the matter. This letter does not propose a specific amount of compensation, but it is recommended that South Korea and Russia to negotiate on the issue of compensation. Korean Air, according to statistics, the casualties caused by the event of a loss of $ 15 million, the aircraft operating loss of $ 84 million. August 30, 1993, the Chief of Staff of the Russian president, Boeing 747 event National Commission of Inquiry on the main Ï¯·ÑÀ­ÍÐ·ò authorized to announce that the Soviet Union is no obligation on the shooting down of the Korean airliner. But unit undermine the rules of navigation and the coupling of a series of unfortunate circumstances led to the plane was shot down. He said that 50 senior experts from Russia, the U.S., South Korea and other countries, conclude that the six-month study in detail. Filatov <br> aircraft deviated from route 250 miles can not be accidental, which is to undermine the results of the then effective regulations and instructions. The other hand, the Soviet air defense system has been tracking the aircraft for more than two hours, but could not be determined for the aircraft in night conditions and mistaken reconnaissance aircraft. Far Eastern Military Command carried out the attack is justified in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of National Defense General Staff of the Soviet Union invasion aircraft to take coercive measures. Aggressor aircraft fire in the closed areas of the test missile without prior warning. He also said that the Committee did not have enough material to confirm the conclusion of the aircraft reconnaissance flight, but the business extremely skilled crew sailing committed a series of serious error \"embarrassing\". <br> in the end is how is it? January 5, 1997, the \"Global Times\" published a story \"I shot down a Korean Airlines 007 passenger plane\" might reveal something. Which wrote: September 1, 1983, Korean Airlines 007 passenger plane deviated from the route of hundreds of kilometers into the Soviet Union&#39;s most sensitive secret base over the results had been shot down on 269 life go all their lives. This is known as the greatest tragedy of the Cold War (Yeltsin language). <br> Korean Airline 007 Why deviate from their routes? Soviet Air Force is making a fuss, disregard for human life? Who Soviet pilot was knowingly broke the law, or the 007 airliner mistake made the RC135 the American reconnaissance plane? Passengers on board all died, there are still detained in the Soviet Union? <br> 13 years around these issues bewildering variety of claims. Not long ago, then personally driving Su -15 fighter shot down a South Korean airliner the retired pilots cells that pedicle ¡¤ °ÂË¹Æ¤Î¬Ææ disclosed a little-known insider. The end of August 1983, Lieutenant Colonel °ÂË¹Æ¤Î¬Ææ from vacation emergency recall on standby for several days, he lived a small room at the end of the runway of Sakhalin in a secret base, doing nothing. Wednesday morning <br> 9, I received an emergency order, an unidentified aircraft is through the Kamchatka Peninsula to Sakhalin flying command is everything for us, and I must act up. My task is to intercept it. Airspace about 95 miles away from the Soviet Union I quickly driving the aircraft with distance eight miles behind it, can already clearly see the big guy, including head and tail lights. My first reaction is that this is a Soviet transport aircraft, air defense department sent test air defense reaction speed, because I simply did not think this would be a foreign aircraft. U.S. intelligence agencies aircraft usually flying along the border of the Soviet Union, and Western commercial aircraft carrying passengers flew the established routes hundreds of miles away Soviet military powerhouse impossible. \"<br>\" With its 60 miles, I drove the Su -15 climb to an altitude of 10,000 meters, and flew it to see what happens next. 150 or 200 meters away, according to the shape of the lights and windows, I judge that this is a civil aircraft. I also saw two rows of windows, and I know this is a Boeing aircraft, a foreign aircraft! \"But the lieutenant colonel not see the cockpit and the passengers, some experts believe that it is because the majority of the windows at night are shut. Ascertain this is a civil aircraft, but grew up in the Cold War era °ÂË¹Æ¤Î¬Ææ lieutenant colonel only use it as part of an anti-Soviet conspiracy, rather than a Trek commercial aircraft. The urgency of the situation, he did not see everything described in detail to the ground commander. \"I did not tell them it was a Boeing aircraft, they did not ask me. I only see the lights were on, may transport aircraft. \"Today, some people still believe that his boss is Lieutenant Colonel overreact. The lieutenant colonel said, originally wanted to wait for it to cross the border will be shot down, but unfortunately, the top does not agree. \"They ordered me to intercept it made a forced landing.\" <br> land in order to force it to fire lieutenant colonel three total injection of 520 hair. Cannon did not dress tracer, it was too dark and can not see. But the lieutenant colonel has that The Korean pilots should be able to see the fire and light, which requires an emergency landing or firing signal. <br> few minutes later, Korean Airlines 007 flew to the sea, can not be delayed any longer, Lieutenant Colonel issued two air-to-air missile hit the target accurately, Korean Airlines 007 crashed into the sea. \"I&#39;d love to forced landing it, very much like you think I want to kill him? I would like him a drink! \"The lieutenant colonel said. Despite <br> know this is an airliner, Lieutenant Colonel still insists that it bears a special mission, and above no passengers. He does not regret personally destroyed it, and even went so honored. <br> he was not quite satisfied with the Soviet authorities to the bonus below his expectations: 200 rubles have net remittance fee! <br> Korean airliner was shot down by the Soviet Air Force shot down <br> Boeing - 747 <br> families of the victims cried <br> ; <br> Korea public protest <br> the'
