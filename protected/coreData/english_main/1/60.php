We represent the people of all ethnic groups of the mainland, and to extend my cordial greetings and sincere congratulations to your compatriots. <br> old saying goes: \"every festival pro. At the moment of celebrating the New Year, we miss more of their own flesh and blood - Taiwan elders and brothers and sisters. We know that, and you have an infinite memory of the motherland and loved ones on the mainland. This stretch of the number of years of mutual feeling is growing. Since the 1949 Taiwan with the motherland unfortunate separation between our audio barrier between sever the motherland can not be unified, and relatives unable to reunite the nation, the state and the people have suffered huge losses. All Chinese compatriots, as well as ethnic Chinese worldwide, and look forward to an early end to this distressing situation. <br> our nation is a great nation, accounting for nearly a quarter of the world&#39;s population, enjoy a long history and culture, are universally recognized for outstanding contribution to world civilization and human development. Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China. The Chinese nation is a strong vitality and cohesion. Despite the history, foreign invasions and internal strife, our nation, have not trapped in long separatism. Nearly three decades with the separation of the motherland, Taiwan, is a man-made, is contrary to the interests and aspirations of our nation, and never be allowed to continue. Bears should not try to shift the responsibility of every Chinese person, whether living in Taiwan or on the mainland, on the survival, development and prosperity of the Chinese nation. The reunification of the motherland such a relationship between the major task of the future of the whole nation, now lies in front of us, who also can not be avoided, and no one should evade. If we do not end as soon as possible this disunity, to achieve the reunification of the motherland at an early date, why should we comfort in ancestors? Why self in future generations? Everybody feels, Xintongcili,,, where the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, who is willing to become the nation sinner? <br> the last three decades, China&#39;s position in the world has undergone a radical change. China&#39;s growing international status, an increasingly important international role. To oppose hegemonism and safeguard peace and stability in Asia and the world, the peoples and governments of almost all countries place great expectations on us. Every Chinese people grew stronger and stronger for the motherland proud. Forces, together as soon as the end of the current split situation, you can contribute to the future of humanity who, since the more limitless. To achieve the reunification of the motherland at an early date, not only is the entire Chinese people, including the common aspiration of the compatriots in Taiwan, but also around the world all the peace-loving peoples and countries of common hope. <br> today, China&#39;s reunification is the common aspiration of the people and the general trend. The world in general recognizes only one China in recognition of the Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China. The recent Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty signed, and the realization of the normalization of Sino-US relations, the more visible trend of actions, not what anyone not stop. The stability and unity of the motherland, the situation is better than ever. People of all ethnic groups in the continent, is the great goal of realizing the four modernizations concentric do my best. We look forward to Taiwan as soon as possible return to the motherland and the common development of the Founding of the Republic. Our national leaders have expressed their determination must consider the realities of the complete reunification of the motherland, respect for the status quo of Taiwan and the opinions of people from all walks of life in Taiwan in resolving the issue of reunification, and to take a reasonable policies and approaches, the people of Taiwan have suffered losses. People from all walks of life in Taiwan have also express nostalgia and old friends, and stated their identity regression \"willing to put forward various suggestions warmly hope to return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date. Today, all the conditions for reunification, and everything is set, no one should go against the will of the nation, against the tide of history. <br> we hope to seventeen million people of Taiwan, and also the Taiwan authorities. Taiwan authorities have always adhered to the one-China stance, and opposition to Taiwan independence. This is our common position on the basis of cooperation. We have consistently advocated patriotic one. Reunification of the motherland is everyone&#39;s responsibility. I hope the Taiwan authorities to national interests and to make a valuable contribution to the cause of reunification of the motherland. <br> Chinese government has ordered the People&#39;s Liberation Army to stop the shelling of the islands of Kinmen from today. The Taiwan Strait is still there is a military confrontation between the two sides, which can only create artificial tension. We believe that this military confrontation in order to create the necessary premise and a safe environment for both a range of engagement should first of all by the end of the talks between the Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Taiwan authorities. <br> isolated due to long-term, the mainland and Taiwan compatriots do not understand each other, and various inconveniences for both sides. Far many overseas Chinese living overseas can return for sightseeing, with their families. Why, within easy reach of the mainland and Taiwan compatriots can not freely? We think there is no reason for such barriers continue to exist. We hope that the two sides as soon as possible to achieve the transportation and postal services, and direct contact with the compatriots of both sides, the exchange of information, visiting friends and relatives, travel to visit the academic culture of sports and technological. <br> Taiwan and the mainland, it could have been a whole economic. Over the years, the economic ties unfortunate interruption. Now, the construction of the motherland is booming, and we also hope that Taiwan&#39;s economy has become increasingly prosperous. Between should develop trade exchanges, and economic exchanges. This is a mutual need, are beneficial and harmless against any party. <br> dear compatriots in Taiwan: <br> a promising future for our great motherland, both belong to us, and also belongs to you. The reunification of the motherland, history assigns the sacred mission of our generation. Times are ahead in the development of the situation. Earlier we fulfill this mission, the sooner we can work together to create brilliant history of China&#39;s unprecedented, and to keep pace with advanced power, conspiracy, world peace, prosperity and progress.
