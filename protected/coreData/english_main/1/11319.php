'cont'=>'(Awake October 29), December 1, 1994, Beijing began the implementation of the minimum wage requirement. <br> 1994 12 1, 2009, the minimum wage in Beijing provides that \"the official implementation of all employment in the Beijing citizens can enjoy a minimum wage of at least 1.1 yuan per hour, or at least 210 yuan a month, which is the protection of the law. the <br> was the first time I heard the majority of Chinese people for the term &#39;minimum wage&#39;. Similarly, a television interview on minimum wage, the answer does not know or know of good workers indifferent economic efficiency of enterprises. Minimum wage laborers in the work within the time prescribed by national laws and regulations, under the premise of providing labor in their enterprises should pay minimum labor remuneration, the remuneration is to meet the basic life of the individual workers and their family members are required expenses. <br> market economy as well as the diversification of the economic elements complicate labor relations. Before the introduction of the \"Labor Law\", China&#39;s lack of comprehensive regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of laborers, the city, there have been few corporate default, deduction of wages of workers or the product arrived wages, especially in state-owned enterprises as well as non- public-owned enterprises, free to work longer hours, and is not guaranteed to have occurred when the workers&#39; minimum labor remuneration. Less fat or non-fat wages of workers labor dispute cases have increased significantly. Only the first half of this year, the city on the admissibility of 137 such cases, an increase of 391% from 35 in the year 1993 from. Some cases even lead to a collective work stoppage affecting the social stability in the capital. The establishment of a minimum wage system is very necessary for the suppression of the occurrence of this phenomenon, and maintaining social stability. <br> the enactment of the minimum wage according to the municipal statistics department in 1993, the city provides employment and their dependents the lowest cost of living of the population, the average wage level, labor productivity, urban employment situation and the economic development level of data, using the common proportion of international law and the Engel coefficient method estimates. In 1993, the Municipal Bureau of Statistics, the city of urban residents per capita monthly minimum living cost standard of $ 160, multiplied by the the dependents coefficient 1.42 after, according to the actual situation in the city and the capacity of enterprises to make proper adjustments obtained 210 $ this figure, and as the city&#39;s minimum wage, the amount to protect individual workers and their dependent family members of the lowest living standards. <br> \"Labor Law\" Article 48 stipulates: national implementation of a minimum wage guarantee system. The employer shall pay laborers wages below the local minimum wage standard. <br> Beijing minimum wage provisions in addition to the defined range of persons to enjoy a minimum wage, minimum wage included, also provides: enterprises to pay workers wages below the minimum wage workers the right to request complement, requiring companies to pay compensation, the compensation owed from the minimum wage to the 6th range of 20-100% of the payment owed part of the minimum wage for more than three months. Fails to do so in violation of regulations, punishable by a fine of 3000-5000 yuan, 100-500 yuan of the enterprise and direct responsibility. In serious cases, the Bureau of Labor can be brought to the Trade and Industry Bureau to give enterprises suspend production for rectification or revoke its business license penalties. Lssdjt.cn <br> Municipal Labor Bureau Secretary Liu Zhihua said bad because of the economic benefits, the low level of wages at the stipulated time, the implementation of the minimum wage is really difficult to state-owned and collective enterprises, can be reported to the Bureau of Labor approve the application suspend execution, but the longest suspension of time shall not exceed six months. If any suspension can not solve the problem, can apply for wages reserved for households, enterprise between the purchase price, this part of the amount set aside in advance to ensure that wages paid normally controlled by the banks. If these two measures still can not guarantee the issuance of minimum wage workers, enterprises should be strictly in accordance with relevant state regulations, economic layoffs and even bankruptcy. Even the minimum wages of workers 210 yuan are unable to pay for the enterprise value of survival loses, the minimum wage is one of the signs of trade-off corporate bankruptcy. <br>'
