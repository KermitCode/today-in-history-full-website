Beijing-Kowloon Railway is not only unusual speed and excellent quality, and create a new record in the history of railway construction in China, but also for future large-scale railway construction has accumulated valuable experience. Along the Beijing-Kowloon Railway bountiful, mineral-rich, radiation population of tens of millions. When completed, will no doubt be greatly facilitated along the property and the development of mineral resources, and promote the development of areas along the rapid development of economically underdeveloped areas.
