In In December 1999, the human genome project, a joint research team of 216 scientists from Britain, the United States, Japan, moderate country officially announced that they have completely deciphered the 22 pairs of human chromosomes genetic code, to determine the exact position of the pair of the 33.4 million base pairs contained in all the protein coding genes in the chromosomes. This is the first human to complete the determination of the complete sequence of human chromosome gene. Scientists generally believe that this is another breakthrough of humanity in the fields of science. A total <br> human chromosome 23 pairs, 22 pairs of chromosomes which small studies have shown that, with the immune system, congenital heart disease, schizophrenia, unresponsive and leukemia, as well as a variety of cancers.
