'cont'=>'August 1, 2010 (, GY June 21), the fifth Beidou navigation satellite was successfully launched. In In am on August 1, 2011, China at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the \"Long March III A carrier rocket, successfully fifth Beidou navigation satellite into space transfer orbit, which is an inclined geosynchronous orbit satellite, is a row this year launch the third Beidou navigation system network satellite. introduce the person in charge of <br> special management office of China&#39;s satellite navigation system, Beidou satellite navigation system (COMPASS, the Chinese transliteration the name of BeiDou) as our independent development, independently run global satellite navigation system, countries are building the basis of spatial information facilities, can be widely used in various fields of economic and social. The system is able to provide high-precision, highly reliable positioning, navigation and timing services, with the combination of navigation and communication service characteristics, through 19 years of development, surveying and mapping, fishery, transportation, telecommunications, water, forest fire prevention, disaster mitigation and relief and national security, and many other areas. Played a very important role in Wenchuan, Sichuan, Qinghai Yushu earthquake relief. <br> in accordance with the \"three-step\" development strategy, the Beidou satellite navigation system will by 2012 have the service capabilities of the Asia-Pacific region, about 2020, built by more than 30 satellites, ground segment, and various types of user terminals constitute a global coverage of large aerospace systems. Beidou satellite navigation system is technically complex, large-scale building applications, will be developed from a single star to a group batch production in China&#39;s aerospace from policyholders star success successful networking to Paul, as the core from the satellite to the system as the core, from historic transformation of mass users, industry-oriented user to open a new journey of China&#39;s aerospace industry. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) <br> Review: Beidou satellite system is an important strategic asset. <br>'
