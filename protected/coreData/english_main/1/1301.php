'cont'=>'February 1, 1903 the fourth day of the first month (mao), the famous British physicist, mathematician Stokes passed away in Cambridge. <br> Stokes Cambridge&#39;s death \"target =\" _blank \"> Stokes. G.G <br> Stokes. GG (1819-1903) British mechanics, mathematicians Born August 13, 1819 Sike Lin, February 1, 1903 and died in Cambridge in 1849 Lucas Block, professor at the University of Cambridge in 1851 elected to the Royal Society Member since 1854 Society secretary, 30 years after being elected to the Royal Society. Stokes Block Professor of Lucas after I. Newton, the second person of the three duties of the secretary of the Royal Society, the Royal Society. <br> main contribution is study of the law of motion of viscous fluid 1821 with a sticky reflect constant equation of motion. Stokes in 1845 starting from switch to continuous mechanical model and the physical laws of Newtonian viscous fluid, \"On the Movement given the basic equations of viscous fluid movement theory of internal friction and elastic body balance and movement of fluids in theory \", which contains two constants, this set of equations known as the Navier - Stokes equation, it is a fluid dynamics the basic equations in 1851, Stokes in the study of the fluid friction pendulum movement \"in the formula of the resistance by the slower movement of the sphere in a viscous fluid, specified resistance flow rate and viscosity proportional resistance Storrs formula [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] Stokes found that the non-linear characteristics of the fluid surface waves, the wave velocity depends on the volatility, and for the first time with the camera dynamic approach to nonlinear wave problem (1847) <br> Stokes elasticity study, he pointed out that there are two basic resistance, resistance to volume compressibility and shear isotropic elastic body of resistance, a clear introduction of the the compression stiffness shear stiffness (1845), proved elastic longitudinal wave is no the spin capacity expansion wave elastic shear wave isovolumic distorted wave (1849). (history today www.lssdjt.com) <br> Adams Stokes field theory in math on a conversion formula between the line integral and area points (Stokes equation) is known for. <br>'
