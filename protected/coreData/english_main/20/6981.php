(Lssdjt.com) <br> nice talk about \"ism\", is very easy to do, cat, dog can do things, the parrots and phonograph can do. <br> talk about foreign imports \"isms\" is not useful. All doctrine are caring people of a certain time, then relief that places the needs of the community. We do field research to social needs, to talk about so and so &#39;single will be high, like doctors Single remember many soup verses, instead of studying the patient&#39;s symptoms, and how useful it? <br> Third The bias \"isms\" of the paper, is very dangerous. This mantra is very easy to do all sorts of evil things shameless politicians. Chinese politicians now also using some certain doctrine deceptive. Ms. Luo Lan said, \"Freedom! Freedom! World what crimes are by your name made!\" Everything nice &#39;, there is this danger. why <br> so much talk about &#39;the people? why so few people do research problem? due to a lazy word. Lazy defined expediency. The research problem is a very difficult thing, and the high talk &#39;is a very easy thing. <br> should hurry to solve the problem is really very many. Which is not to the President permission from the livelihood of rickshaw pullers, from prostitution to Maiguan traitorous, from the dissolution of Anfu Ministry to join the League of Nations, to the men&#39;s liberation from the women&#39;s liberation ... feel the burn emergency problem? <br> we do not study the livelihood of rickshaw pullers about socialism, but went to high! instead of studying women&#39;s liberation, the family system is how to save the positive talk of wives&#39; and free love, but went to high ! instead of studying the Anfu Ministry how the dissolution of the North-South problem, do not study how to solve, but to high talk about anarchism! We also proudly boasted, \"We are talking about the fundamental solution\". Honestly strike, which is self-deceiving daydream! Chinese intellectual bankruptcy irrefutable evidence! Social improvement of the death penalty declared <br> reviews: Freedom Era of China&#39;s few ideological emancipation < br>'
