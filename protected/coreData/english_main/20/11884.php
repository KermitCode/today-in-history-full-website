'cont'=>'December 20, 1987 (on October 30 Dingmao), the construction of the then second largest hydropower station. <br> 1987 6:10 this morning the western Yunnan the roaring Lancang River, the first is sliced. Shan-ming Valley firecrackers to people, declared: China&#39;s second largest power station after the Gezhouba Hydropower Station under construction - Manwan hydropower damming the river project in one fell swoop decisive victory. Manwan Power Station, located in the middle reaches of the Lancang River in <br> designed installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts, annual generation capacity of 7.76 billion, is one of the key construction projects of the country \"75\" during. <br> the first time to the Ministry of the Province, the joint venture construction of large hydropower projects, the full implementation of the sub-project tender contract system, created rare in the history of China&#39;s hydropower construction building speed in the competition. Construction preparation has been since October 1985, and the brightest builders only seven months to complete the routine needs three years to complete the workload. The hydropower construction tasks as a diversion tunnel No. 1 14 Bureau builders are fighting day and night to create a large cross section excavation of the diversion tunnel monthly the footage 270 meters national record. In the joint efforts of the ten thousand hydropower builders originally planned damming the river project until the end of 1988, exactly a year earlier. the retaining rock ridge <br> diversion tunnel was blasting on the 15th of this month, the surging river diversion. 8:00 in the evening of 18 truncated Lancang campaign officially started, more than 90 engineering vehicles a long line, turns to the roar of the river dumping carbide slag, lead wire gabion and reinforced concrete blocks, built up a levee to push forward to the middle of the river. At 3:00 on the 20th, when the the Longkou contraction to more than 10 meters, the engineering and technical personnel detonated container gabion scaffold erected at the edge of the cliff across the river, weighing as much as 1,200 tons of container gabion roar backward Longkou closure Warriors multiply The wins advance, finally subdued before dawn Lancang. <br>'
