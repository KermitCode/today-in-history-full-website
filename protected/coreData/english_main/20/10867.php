'cont'=>'November 20, 2009, the fourth day of October (Year of the OX), Europe&#39;s Large Hadron Collider restart. On November 20, the evening of <br> <br>, CERN announced that the European Large Hadron Collider restart the same day, the first proton beam throughout entire collider. The center said, this is an important step forward next year to obtain experimental results on the collider preliminary physical. (Today in History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> local time at 22 o&#39;clock on the 20th (Beijing time at 6:00 on the 21st), the first proton beam clockwise direction throughout the collider, marks the collision The machine has normal use. CERN director Rolf Hoyle says: see proton beam through the Large Hadron Collider very excited about the launch is a big step forward. The \"<br> Europe&#39;s Large Hadron Collider is the world&#39;s largest Hadron Collider. September 10, 2008, the official launch of the collider Collider third paragraph of the tunnel to the fourth paragraph of try 5 trillion electron volt proton beam run from September 19, between two magnets power connected components in the strong current through the melt, leading to the helium leak forced to stop operation of the collider. CERN spent more than a year to repair and reinforcement, in order to avoid the same accident. The researchers of <br> said, throughout the first proton beam clockwise after the collider, the the second beam proton beam will be injected into the collider counterclockwise run. If all goes well, in the next year, they are ready to seven trillion electron volts of energy proton beam collision (per beam proton beam energy of 3.5 trillion electron volts). <br> the Europe Large Hadron Collider near Geneva in Switzerland and France border area 100 meters deep underground, with a total length of about 27 km circular tunnel, it will be for researchers to study the origin of the universe and a variety of basic particle properties to provide strong support. About 7,000 researchers and engineers from more than 80 countries and regions participated in the Large Hadron Collider building. the <br> Comments: This is an enormous project in human history, stoppages, repeatedly restart, sometime ~ <br>'
