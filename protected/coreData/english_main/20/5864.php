'cont'=>'June 20, 1923, the seventh day May (Guihai,), love big discussion came to an end. <br> 1923 20, 2009, the love Dr. Zhang Jingsheng hopes early end of this love big discussion. Post a public reply article on his \"Morning Supplement\" reply \"discuss the rules of love\" to end this controversy. The reason for him ahead of the respondent, is eager to travel to Mongolia and northeast, and so was unable to bear. <br> Zhang Jingsheng first refuted in the text \"Love is mysterious, unconditional\" view. He said, love is not a mystery, but some people see it as a mystery. Love and conditions can not be separated, unconditional loveless. Those opposed to the \"love conditionally rule, but admitted that\" love is a combination of a variety of feelings, which is tantamount to definitely feelings is the first condition constitutes love. \"Honor, landscape ever, the property\" Can be included in the conditions of love? Zhang Jingsheng, his so-called \"honor\", that is meritorious, moral, article name, of course is a combination of conditions indispensable happy no lack of love. The landscape ever a love relationship. Beauty, that is one of the United States. If other conditions are met, can be coupled with the conditions of landscape ever love, of course, more happy. As for the property, not just with love relationships, and a broad sense, it is the source of life, all beginning. Personality people can use the property to develop his overwhelming majority of the personality; feelings of the people, can use the property to expand his infinite affection; talented people can use the property to enhance his higher deep to. If the love of the people, in addition the Choi inside out, if feelings of personality, talent, fame, landscape ever various conditions, can it be said that the action for acquisitiveness this? The comparison of the <br> love and change the principles are applicable to marriage? Zhang Jingsheng answer is yes. So-called comparative and change, that does not mean we must go outside in the couple looking for a third party. Has couple people understand love changing rules, should strive upward, so that love day evolution of great benefit for the hearts of mankind to change our habits, never seductive evil in. \"Husband and wife as a friend of a friend said this must then generally refers, is generalized friends; couples than ordinary friend, just as said horse is one of the beasts, and is with the same the beasts \"cow\" is not the same. To prove that the couple is not a friend of a couple&#39;s sex life, Zhang Jingsheng can not agree. He believes that sexual intercourse and love are entirely two different things, first love, and then have sexual intercourse, not first sexual intercourse, then only love, although not husband and wife, and also sexual intercourse; if so happy, with or without sexual intercourse, love are the same. Zhang Jingsheng (lssdjt.cn) <br> respondent after \"Morning Supplement published three letters from, the discussion then announcing the termination of this month. <br>'
