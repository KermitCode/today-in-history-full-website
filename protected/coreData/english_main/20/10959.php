For example, they committed counterrevolutionary crimes, (lssdjt.cn) both in accordance with the the \"punishing counter-revolutionary Ordinance enacted in 1951, or in accordance with the Criminal Law enacted in 1979\" be considered a crime. Another example, in 1953 approved by the Government Administration Council Administrative Conference has the force of law, \"the second session of the National Judicial Conference Resolution provides for\" deliberately framed the bad elements of the good guys, or relying too retaliation to the defendant to major damage false accusations elements \"in the law\" should be investigated \";\" counterrevolutionaries deliberately created the false cases framed good ...... must legally handed over to the authorities, the most serious and is punishable by death. \" The fourth meeting of the National People&#39;s Congress decided in 1957, to be examined and revised by the Standing Committee in accordance with the views of the representatives, the pilot as the publication of the draft, the courts at all levels as to decide cases based on actual draft penal code section 22 the provisions of the draft, the conspiracy the crime of secession to subvert the government, led or instigated the armed forces of the mutineers, the death penalty or life imprisonment.
