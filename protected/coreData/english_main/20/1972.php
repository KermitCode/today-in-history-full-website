'cont'=>'February 20, 1968 (, Shigenobu In the first month, 22), the Chinese Academy of Space Technology was established. China Academy of Space Technology, <br> Rongzhen recommendations, approved by Mao Zedong established on February 20, 1968. As the cradle of China&#39;s satellite, the China Academy of Space Technology, 30 years developed and launched communications, the return remote sensing, meteorological and scientific exploration technology test four series of more than 30 satellites, China began to form a high level of function of supporting the long-term The stable operation of the satellite development and application of the system, a major shift of China&#39;s space technology from the pilot phase to the application stage. <br> in the efforts of the researchers of the satellite design level, recovery control technology, multi-satellite technology, satellite positioning technology, and ground-based data synchronization instruction fetch technology and other aspects have been close to the world advanced level. China&#39;s developed and launched a series of satellites are widely used in various fields of the national economy, and played an important role in the radio and television, data transmission, Homeland census, oil exploration, satellite disaster reduction. <br> since the reform and opening up, China Academy of Space Technology is a useful exploration in the management system and operational mechanism and establishing a socialist market economy, combining institutional changes by a single military to military and civilian, in developing domestic and foreign applications satellites and satellite application market has made great progress, and make an important contribution to China Aerospace place in the world aerospace industry. [Lssjt.cn] <br> February 1998, held in Beijing China Academy of Space Technology celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the hospital.

[? V history today?? Com] <br> Song said the cause of space technology is a very important strategic industry, it is to improve the overall national strength, consolidating national defense, to defend the national security of key science and technology. The space industry is an integral part of an important industry in the national economy and the people&#39;s livelihood in one.
