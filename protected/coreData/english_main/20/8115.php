'cont'=>'(Mao, July tenth day), August 20, 1915, winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, the death of German bacteriologist Ehrlich. <br> in the late 19th century, a disease called syphilis spread worldwide. This disease in Europe more than 400 years of history, a highly contagious, spread quickly and thousands of people lost their lives, but people could not challenge. Until April 1910, the German bacteriologist Ehrlich invented the \"six hundred and six men, freed from the threat of this disease. <br> Ehrlich was born on April 14, 1854 in German Silesia Stern. The father was a Jewish doctor. Him since childhood, they suffered the pain of racial discrimination, the ambition to become a good doctor, general Tranquility people. That time, the naked eye can not see germs, being furious raging in Europe and the world, infectious diseases claimed the lives of tens of millions of people. Ehrlich witnessed this tragic reality, he had just entered the School of Medicine door set a compelling vision: \"I must invent a magic bullet, it only shot of the bacteria of the human body without harm to human body. \"<br> 1878, Ehrlich received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Leipzig. He was recommended to Europe at that time the largest pathology Institute of Experimental Pathology pioneering, professor at the University of Berlin Frei Li Xisi assistant. Him from staining analysis method for testing paper by colorimetric distinguish a human body, animals, bacteria and normal tissue, is known as the Ehrlich reaction. Soon, he founded the \"side-chain theory\", that organism and the surrounding chemical substances (food, drugs, etc.) combined with the doctrine, which in turn derived scientific theory of immunochemical and chemotherapy. <br> Ehrlich Medical theoretically make a significant contribution, put in his later years all our energy into chemical drug development, in order to realize his ambition as a young man - with \"magic bullets & rdquo ; shot the body of the bacteria. In 1904, he finally found a dye can kill mice Trypanosoma °¢ÍÐ¿ËÎ÷¶û \", also known as the\" Trypanosoma red \", that Aminobenzenearsonic. However, this drug can kill germs, treatment consequences miserable, the patient, though not fatal, they become blind. He decided to change the Aminobenzenearsonic the chemical structure, synthesis thousands of species of arsine benzene compound and then subjected 11 filters, one of the \"six hundred and six\" diamino of dioxo-coupling arsonium benzene obtained in practice Ehrlich ambition. Some medicine to diamino the dioxo even of arsine benzene customarily called \"six hundred and six, and later became the name of the drug used. In 1908, Ehrlich won the Nobel medicine prize.
