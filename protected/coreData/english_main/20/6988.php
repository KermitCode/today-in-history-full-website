(l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> Marconi, 1874 25 May, was born Bologna in Italy, and he had at Leghorn learn from that and Bologna him in several prestigious teachers under the guidance of learning physics, and have the opportunity to learn about some physicists work in electromagnetic radiation. Marconi on the use of the Hertz \"invisible rays transmit Morse code very interested, and in 1894 began this work in his father&#39;s manor test. Marconi developed the new system has the scientific and practical , and soon will be able to send radio signals to a distance of two kilometers away, Asahi little sponsorship to continue his work in Italy, so it was suggested that he go to England. <br> 1896 Mark Nepal to London, where, he spent a period of five years, experiments and improved the performance of the equipment and to expand the range of the transmission, greatly enhance the communication application value, and the British Army, the Navy department&#39;s attention. 1897 He helped establish wireless telegraphy Communications Limited, the company&#39;s 19 muscle become wireless telegraphy Marconi Co., Ltd.
