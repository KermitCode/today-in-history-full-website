'cont'=>'November 20, 1999 October 13 (JiMao years), China&#39;s manned space project, the first flight test successfully. <br> CPC Central Committee General Secretary and State President and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin of China&#39;s manned space project first spacecraft --- \"Shenzhou\" spacecraft Title. <br> Beijing time at 6:30 on November 20 1999, China&#39;s first manned spaceflight experimental spacecraft \"Shenzhou\", China&#39;s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the newly built spaceport launch. After completion of the predetermined space scientific experiments, at 3:41 on the 21st, the spacecraft successfully in the central region of Inner Mongolia landing. This is the first flight test of China&#39;s manned space project, marking a new major breakthrough in China&#39;s manned space technology. <br> CPC Central Committee General Secretary and State President and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin for the spacecraft Title: \"Shenzhou\". The CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, call our warm congratulations. experimental spacecraft and <br> The launch of the new rocket, which is China&#39;s independent development. Belongs to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group of the Institute of Space Technology, Shanghai Aerospace Technology Research Institute of Carrier Rocket Technology Research Institute developed mainly. This flight test, the spacecraft did not manned. Ground preparation stage, the launch center with international advanced level \"three vertical mode, that technology plant on the spacecraft, rocket Commonwealth of vertical assembly, test, and then the vertical transportation to the launch site. Spacecraft, the final test of the rocket and launch, through remote control. According to reports, technological innovation is a breakthrough in China&#39;s aerospace test launch technology. Evaluation of the space community experts here, this launch breakthrough in manned space technology has great significance, is China&#39;s aerospace history and a milestone. <br> of TT & C network based on existing, new Lu Haiji TT & C network in line with international standards system. This monitoring network is put into use for the first time in this test launch. Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center organized the launch of the spacecraft tracking, measurement and control of the test. <br> TT & C network returns data, about 10 minutes after takeoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket into orbit. Experimental spacecraft in orbit during the ground-based monitoring system and \"Yuan Wang tracking ship its tracking and monitoring and control, and successfully carried out a series of scientific experiments. <br> organization of the person in charge of relevant departments of the emission test, told reporters of the manned space flight test of the rocket and spacecraft, with high security and reliability. From flight results, the test achieved a great success, is an important step in the development of our country&#39;s manned space comprehensive breakthrough and master manned space technology has great significance. <br> talked about the significance of the development of our country&#39;s manned space The official said that, by virtue of our own strength to overcome a lot of technical difficulties, these technologies involve new technologies, new materials, new technology and other fields, these areas technological advances will play an important role in promoting the. He said, manned spaceflight is the largest aerospace sector since the founding of systems engineering, is a nationwide collaboration crystallization. And so will have the relevant units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Information Industry and other departments to participate in the project development, testing, and update the development, production, testing and other means of work organization for the rich aerospace systems engineering management experience, to solve the problem of space technology shortage of talent positive impact. From the current situation, personnel training, through the old with the new, there are a large number of young people into important positions. the <br> Beijing at 6:30 on November 20, the \"Shenzhou\" spacecraft at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in New Long March carrier rocket for launch.
