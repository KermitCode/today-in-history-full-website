'cont'=>'May 20, 2010 (on April seventh day GY), the world&#39;s first \"artificial life\" was born in the United States. The American biologist <br> the artificial bacteria kernel <br> called \"artificial child <br> Craig Venter to create life <br> U.S. scientists are making the completely artificial genetic control of single-celled bacteria <br> on May 20, 2010, U.S. scientists announced the world&#39;s first artificial life \"in the United States was born\" target = \"_blank\"> artificial life --- completely by artificial The genetic control of single-celled bacteria was born, and named it \"artificial child. This landmark experiments show that the new life forms in the laboratory \"was created, and instead must be done through the\" evolution \". <br> \"a new era of\" <br> The study was chaired by the American genetics leading scientists Craig Venter, which lasted 10 years at a cost of over 40 million U.S. dollars. The research team has a total of more than 20 scientists. <br> called \"the artificial child\" the artificial bacteria kernel transplantation in the laboratory, a completely synthetic genome. Where Dr. Dement said this means \"a new era\". (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> scientists first select a bacteria called Mycoplasma mycoides, decode and copy its genome to produce artificial synthetic genome. Artificial genome is then transplanted into another bacterium called Mycoplasma capricolum, through the division and proliferation of bacteria within cells gradually artificial gene control, and eventually become a whole new life. In a petri dish, the synthetic bacterial division behaves like natural bacteria. <br> scientists 4 is written in the \"artificial children\" DNA \"watermark sequence\" it differs from similar natural bacterial, as well as in the progeny of such a biological identification of its \"ancestor . \" <br> \"When cells with a watermark live over, we are ecstatic, it is a living creature, and become part of the variety of life in our planet. \"Where Dr. Dement said. the <br> broad application prospects <br> Although this technology is still in the experimental stage, but the researchers believe that the broad prospects for its use. <br> research team plans first synthesized the minimum number of genes available for the existence of life, and then through to which compensate for the other genes, the manufacture of a new series of microbes, such as can produce the biofuels bacteria, useful drugs, can start The bacteria absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the air, or manufacture of a synthetic vaccine protein. principle illustrated <br> of <br> artificial life scientists selected a bacterium called Mycoplasma mycoides chromosome decoding. Little by little, and then using a chemical method to rearrange the DNA. <br> 2. recombinant DNA fragments into the yeast mixture, so that it slowly re-polymerization. <br> 3. artificial DNA into a receptor bacteria. Through the growth and separation of the recipient bacterium to produce two cells with a synthetic DNA, and another with natural DNA. <br> 4. petri dishes antibiotics with the natural DNA cell killing, leaving only an artificial cell proliferation. (Lssjt.cn within) <br> few hours, all traces of the original DNA receptor bacterial disappeared, artificial cells continuously multiply. The birth of new life. <br> Opponents say \"open Pandora&#39;s Box\" <br> \"create life\" once again stirred up the old debate: whether humans can play God? <br> Oxford University ethics professor Julian, Saout Lai Siku think: \"Infante pushed through the main door is the most important in the history of mankind, the most basic --- spy life nature. He directly play the role of God --- to create a new life does not exist in nature originally. The groups responsible person named \"<br> human genomics warning\" David King said: \"Venter is tantamount to opening Pandora&#39;s Box. Opponents argue that artificial organisms spread to the nature, caused by changes in the biological gene, may cause environmental disaster, they also may be used to make biological weapons.
