'cont'=>'July 20, 1969 (, Jiyou In June the seventh day), the man to the moon. the <br> moon Pioneer: (from left to right) Neil - Armstrong - Michael Collins and Edwin - Buzz Aldrin <br> 1969, July 16, at 9 o&#39;clock in the morning, 32 points in 39A launch pad at Cape Kennedy, the Apollo 11 spacecraft together with thirty-six-story buildings Saturn 5 rocket launch. Civil aviation captain Neil - Armstrong, and two Air Force officers small Edwin Aldrin Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel Michael - Collins - \"buzzing\" on the spacecraft. The third stage of the Saturn number for putting them through a one hundred eighteen miles high orbit. System checks all the work for two and a half hours later, they re-launched the third-stage rocket, which enable them to acquire the twenty-four thousand two hundred forty-five miles per hour speed, to two hundred and fifty thousand miles from the Earth&#39;s atmosphere outside the moon forward. <br> 50,000 miles from the Earth, Collins manipulation called \"Columbia\" command module, making it vulnerable front of the lunar module called \"Eagle\" or simply LM-relative. \"Columbia\" and \"Eagle\" mutual hooked, the third stage of the Saturn sign is abandoned. Sailing the next day, Thursday, they started running \"Columbia\" engine, so that they can into Saturday on a track in the side of the moon sixty-nine miles. Cape Kennedy on Friday afternoon, Armstrong and Aldrin climb a pipeline between the two means of delivery into the lunar module \"Eagle\" That evening, the astronauts entered the moon&#39;s gravity field. From the moon when they have less than forty-four thousand miles, faster and faster. <br> Saturday afternoon, they speed reduced to three thousand seven hundred thirty-six miles per hour, into orbiting the moon&#39;s orbit. Flight control station (they are loaded with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Houston spacecraft Contact wireless telegraphy machine) on the morning of Sunday, July 20, 7 and 2 minutes to wake them up, because this day is scheduled to land on the moon one day. Eagle cabin, Armstrong and Aldrin to the lunar module landing with four ugly legs stretched out. Air console told them to say: \"You can leave the dock. \"So, the lunar module separated and\" Columbia \", when Armstrong said,\" &#39;Eagle&#39; has long wings! 15:00 8 points, he launched the spacecraft&#39;s engine, so they flew toward the Sea of &#8203;&#8203;Tranquillity on the moon. <br> them into a low orbit, 9.8 miles away from the surface of the moon in a terrible full of mountains and crater on the moon wilderness flight. At this time, Houston&#39;s a computer began to flash on the dashboard to alert them. It is so close to the destination, of course they can not go back, they flew forward according to the instructions of a young commanding officer in Houston Armstrong master manipulator, \"buzzing\" Odling stop reading aloud instrument shows navigational speed and altitude. Decline in the last moment, they had some trouble. When Armstrong found they will be on the broad inaccessible West crater (in their goal, four miles west of this name), the distance between the \"Eagle\" cabin moon has less than 500 feet. He flew unto them outside the crater, but this the prolonged journey unplanned, means he is about to run out of fuel; he must make an immediate decision, or to move over there, either take the risk of crash. In that instant, he was on the front dashboard issued two white showing contact with the moon words. \"Eagle\" cabin has landed. <br> he said, \"Houston, here is Tranquillity Base &#39;Eagle&#39; cabin has landed. \"At this time is Sunday, July 20, 1969, Eastern Daylight Time 16:17:42. instrument <br> to check out three hours later, the two astronauts asked Houston, the possibility of eliminating the need for scheduled four hours of rest time machine now under. Houston replied, \"We support you in this action. \"They put on a spacesuit worth three hundred thousand U.S. dollars, reducing the pressure inside the lunar module. Then Armstrong back facing out, and began to go down from nine of the ladder slowly. He pulled the rope in the second level of the ladder, open the lens of a television camera, half a billion people saw him accidentally falls desolate moon performance up. Half the 9th B boots come into contact with the surface of the moon, he said: \"For one person, this is a small step, but for human beings, which is a huge leap forward. \"At this time is 22:56:20. He shuffled walked up and down on the ground. He said, \"The lunar surface is a thin powder like charcoal powder like my soles and uppers Nianman layer by layer. Step by step down less than one inch deep, and perhaps only one-eighth of an inch, but I can see his footprints in the sand like ground. \"<br> Armstrong that fine powder to put some in his hip pocket of his spacesuit. Then, in his next cabin 19 minutes after Aldrin walked beside him, \"beauty Oh, America Oh, magnificent desolate scenery. \"Armstrong, one of the stakes into the ground on top of the television cameras rack. Look like spiders \"Eagle\" cabin from Lens 60 feet away, is in the center of the television image behind it is the eternal night of Outer Space. Here gravity-sixths of a G only, and 16.6% of the gravity on Earth. TV viewers saw the two men as antelope like jumping around, and to hear Aldrin said, \"When I want to lose balance, I find that is very natural and very easy to restore balance. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) \"He erected the side three feet long, five feet wide American flag, it is tied to a flagpole with wire; Aldrin to salute it. They also store filled with one shot to the telegraph seventy-six leaders container and a stainless steel trim, marked above with the words: \"from the people of the planet Earth era in July 1969 for the first time here foot on the Moon. We are representatives of mankind to peacefully come here. \"<br> At the same time, the whole world is paying attention to the moon. (Lsjt.org) from Australia to Norway, from Kansas City to Warsaw, the ear to the radio, or watch major events on television. It is estimated television audience of about 600 million people, accounting for 1/5 of the total number of people on Earth. Even in countries unfriendly to the United States, the news of this mission to the moon by radio to the attitude of appreciation or at least just reported. <br> Cairo Radio called \"the greatest human achievements of the Apollo moon landing. The secretary of a lawyer in London will move to become simply too great. The actress Gina - ÀÍÂå²¼Àï¼ª up to say: \"This is not the performances of the entertainment industry. \"But,\" I see on TV today will be water far is the most outstanding. \"<br> According to plan, the first trip to the moon, will last less than a day. The lunar module will be held tomorrow 13:55 to take off from the moon. In the command module to fly back to Earth before it is discarded. <br> They began collecting fifty pounds of rocks for the purposes of scientific research, the side measuring their spacesuits outside temperature: 234 degrees Fahrenheit in the sun, the shade is minus 279 degrees. They put on a strip of metal foil to collect particles from the sun, and set up seismometers to record lunar vibration results to telescopes on Earth, and also set up a mirror. \"Eagle\" cabin in the middle of the night they returned a total of twenty-one hours and three 47 minutes after the engine left the moon to stay on the moon (flight control station said: \"You can take off. & Rdquo ; Aldrin said: \"We are the number one machine on the waterway.\") return to orbit, they stay in Columbia \"Collins joined Collins two flight instruments re-hook together. From the pipe, they climb over and stay with him, \"Hawk cabin were let go and drift into space, and finally crashed on the moon. <br> 1:56, Collins Columbia toward the Earth, on the engine, the command module from the gravitational pull of the moon. The backhaul needs sixty hours. That evening, the astronauts sent to Earth by the TV up a photo from the photos of the Earth one hundred seventy-five thousand miles away. Aldrin said: \"I was sitting here watching the Earth become increasingly large moon becoming smaller and smaller, this scenario is beautiful Oh. Armstrong said: \"Whether you sail to go home is always a good thing.\" \"Thursday, they sailed to the hour twenty-four thousand six hundred and two miles of speed fifty-seven miles over the Pacific Ocean to re-enter the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. At this stage is the most critical moment, the spacecraft baffle is burned by the high temperature of 4,000 degrees. Cloud surrounded the command module, radio contact was interrupted three minutes. the <br> waiting aircraft carrier \"Hornet\" on the radar has been detected are landing \"Columbia\" three eighty-three feet 13.8 miles away in orange and white parachute drop next Illness. Then, this command module splashed down in the sea, sparking six feet tall big waves, and tipping. But after the trio of cabin efforts on the side of the airbags charged gas, immediately to enable it to restore the balance. \"Hornet\" to take off in the helicopter hovering overhead guide only spacecraft bound for the destination.
