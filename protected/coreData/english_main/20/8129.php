'cont'=>'August 20, 1968 (, Shigenobu July 27), the death of the Russian American astronomer and physicist George Gamow. <br> <br> <br> George Gamow (George Gamow, 1904 -1968 years, 20 days), Russian American Physical founder of scientists, astronomers, science writer, the hot big bang model of cosmology. <br> Gamow was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1904, his father is a teacher. Gamow teenager has experienced the turmoil of war and revolution, 1922 to enter the new Russian universities, [l $ j¦Ó.c¨½] soon go to Leningrad University studying optical, had studied under the famous cosmologist Alexander ¡¤ Friedman learn Friedman cosmological model. Received his Ph.D. in 1928. Has between 1928 to 1932 at the University of Gottingen, Germany, the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and the United Kingdom Cambridge University Cavendish Laboratory under the tutelage of the famous physicist Niels Bohr and Rutherford engaged in research work. During the University of Gottingen, Gamow quantum theory applied to the nuclei, explained the ¦Á-decay. <br> 1931, Gamow was recalled to the Soviet Union, appointed chief researcher of the Leningrad Academy of Sciences, a physics professor at the University of Leningrad. At that time under the Stalin regime, suppressed Gamow feel their own imaginative nature, very unhappy. Attended the meeting held in Brussels, Belgium, in 1933, the Gamow seize the opportunity to leave the Soviet Union. Leave the Soviet Union, Gamow engaged in research at the Curie Institute in Paris, France, immigrated to the United States in 1934 as a lecturer at the University of Michigan, University of Washington professor hired as the District of Columbia in the autumn of the same year. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) during the work of the University of Washington, Gamow is principally engaged in the study of cosmology and astrophysics, the development of the Big Bang model of the universe, and to study the problem of the origin of the chemical elements in the initial stages of the universe, this period the pinnacle of his academic career, has made a series of important research results. 1954, Gamow served as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956, he was appointed professor at the University of Colorado and Research Center turned to molecular biology. During this period, Gamow the genetic code of the DNA molecule. The Big Bang Theory <br> modern first proposed in 1932 by the Belgian priest Lemaitre. 1940s, Gamow, together with two of his students - Ralph Alfie and Robert Herman, the theory of relativity introduction of cosmology proposed a model of the hot big bang cosmology. Hot Big Bang cosmological model, the universe was originally started in high temperature and high density of the raw material, the temperature exceeds billions. With the expansion of the universe, the temperature is decreased, the formation of galaxies and other celestial bodies now. They also predicted the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation. 1964 radio engineers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation, confirmed their predictions. <br> 1940&#39;s, Gamow assigned The Alfie to study the elements synthesized in the Big Bang theory. Alfie doctoral thesis submitted in 1948, Gamow convinced Hans Bethe put his name in the papers Department, took their name Department at the end, so that, the homophonic exactly composed of three individuals name The first three Greek letters ¦Á, ¦Â, ¦Ã. So this flag of the Big Bang model papers on behalf of Alfred, Bethe, Gamow three, on April 1, 1948 April Fool day published called ¦Á¦Â¦Ã theory. <br> <br> Gamow still an excellent science writer, science profession regarded as a great master. His life officially published 25 books in 18 popular science works, the most representative of the Physical World Adventures. In this work, Gamow successfully portrayed only know figures do not understand the scientific staff of the bank, Mr. Tompkins characters through the wonderful experience of his of sleepwalking physical illusion, humor, humor, vivid language, physical learn important concepts introduced to the reader, to get a great deal of success. 1956 Gamow get the the UNESCO awarded ¿¨ÁÖÙ¤¿ÆÆÕ Award. <br> Comments: a very great scientist, high honor in many ways. <br>'
