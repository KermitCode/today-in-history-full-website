'cont'=>'(Otomi, April 20), May 20, 1965, the Chinese aircraft designer Wong Chee one thousand died. the Wong Chi one thousand, <br> after the death of the \"target =\" _blank \"> Wong Chi thousands (19141.23 ~ 1965.5.20), born 24 January 1914 in Jiangsu Province, Huaiyin County into the primary school in 1919, 1926 year high graduation obtain Yuan Jiang Middle School student, due to the difficulties of family life, dropping out of school homeschooling after graduation in July 1944 in Zhenjiang Teachers admitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Shanghai Jiaotong University, after graduating in 1947, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he had a distinct anti-Japanese national salvation volunteering Nanjing National Government Air Force, trained aviation mechanics school graduation <br> 1948, he was removed in the barrier allowed, Yunnan, Kunming, (history com) Myanmar Bhamo, Xinjin aircraft factory , responsible for and participate in the Hawk - III зк-15 зк-16 aircraft repairs and airport services in October 1944, he went to the U.S. the Convair aircraft manufacturing company of any employee to participate in a B-24 bomber stress analysis of the twin-engine transport aircraft design, manufacture, and 240 \"air palace\". <br> 1945 War Victory Aviation Institute he entered the University of Michigan to study mechanics. September 1946, the Nanjing National Government Gloucestershire and British aircraft manufacturing company signed a cooperation protocol design fighter jets, the Huang Zhi equal and his party then flew to the United Kingdom to participate in the design work. During this time, he carefully studied the British \"meteor\" type of advanced fighter jets and EI44-jet Fighter technical information, directly participated in the structural design of the rear fuselage so that he benefited from working through the design, provides technical reference and valuable practical experience for his later design fighter <br> 1949 month, Wong Chi 1000 boat away from the British, via Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong and North Korea Incheon, be back in June after returning history www.TodayOnHistory.com] Wong Chi one thousand Huadong Military Region Aeronautical Engineering Laboratory immediately involved in the drafting of the construction plans of the early days of aviation industry, and is responsible for the construction of Fujian Province, Jian&#39;ou airport in July 1951, he was transferred to the Shenyang Aircraft Factory Design Acting Chief, responsible for the Korean War combat aircraft зозкзд-9 and зозкзд- 15 repair work In 1954, Wong Chi 1000 served as the Aviation Industry Bureau Technology Section Design Team Leader assist Chief of organizations, leadership and management of the design of the aircraft factory work, and for repairs знa-9 wing aircraft preparation static test for technical guidance. early 1956, he took part in the formulation of the twelve years the development of China&#39;s science and technology planning in August of the same year, China&#39;s first set up in Shenyang Aircraft Design and Research Office, Wong Chi one thousand was appointed the deputy director of the chamber designer he co-led with the leadership of other designers create a work of the design studio, and design of the FT-1 jet trainer. Subsequently, he participated in the organization and leadership of the CJ-6 type primary trainer and strong -5 attack aircraft overall program design. <br> 1961, Aviation Institute of Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute was founded Huang Zhi one thousand and was appointed as the chief architect and he, together with other leaders of the organization and leadership first the creation of the work of the Institute of Aircraft Design and development of the F-8 \"high-altitude high-speed fighter successfully laid the technical foundation of the first task after the establishment of the <br> Shenyang Aircraft Design Studio is a high- subsonic jet trainer aircraft of the FT-1 \"design, and his performance of the aircraft should be quite kind in the world aircraft, the material should be based on domestic resources; maximum flight speed of 700 to 800 km / h, a range of about 1000 km; aircraft ceiling is more than 12 km, the body is fully metal structure, tricycle landing gear; intake on both sides, the two-seater, trapezoidal monoplane overall aerodynamic layout Practice has proved that he is responsible for the review of the main structural drawings analysis and aerodynamic, strength, static and dynamic test and flight test validation, calculated analysis of data and test data are consistent FT-1 aircraft from November 1956 to begin design to fly overhead before July 1958, only time of 1 year and 9 months of its development cycle than Japan, Poland, Czechoslovakia and contemporary trainer development cycle short <br> in 1965, 20, the Wong Chi one thousand visits to Western Europe, via Cairo over aircraft unfortunate victims of the crash, was posthumously martyr of the CMC at the age of 51 years old. <br> \"meteor\" fighter <br> MIG-15 (rear) is the main fighter of the Korean War the <br> FT-1 aircraft smooth lines and crisp <br> prototype <br> <br> F-7 F-8 is the first true high-speed high-altitude fighter < br>'
