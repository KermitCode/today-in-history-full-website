'cont'=>'Started April (““≥Û to), May 20, 1985, Deng Xiaoping put forward against the bourgeoisie, bourgeois liberalization. Reference May 1985, Deng Xiaoping and Chen Ku-ying conversation. Deng Xiaoping said, we adhere to socialism on the mainland, not to take the capitalist evil ways. Characteristics of socialism, that is, the creation of wealth, the first owned by the state, the second owned by the people, will not produce new bourgeoisie. <br> he said, this part of the country to take is for the people, used to engage in education, engage in science, but also conduct national defense; more to improve people&#39;s living standards, raise the cultural level of the people. Different places between socialism and capitalism is the common prosperity and worship of Western capitalist countries, \"democracy\", \"freedom\", the negation of socialism, it would not do. China wants to modernization, and must not engage in liberalization must not take the Western capitalist road. It is not enough to bourgeois liberalization and violated the criminal law, not dealt with severely. Because they engage in this set is nothing more than Naruto, big place, posters, the illegal publications, is actually a turmoil, is the legacy of the style of the \"Cultural Revolution\", so that the shares can not wind up. (History today www.lssdjt.com) <br> China should adhere to the socialist system, and to the development of the socialist economy, to achieve the four modernizations, there is no ideal is not enough, there is no stability is not acceptable. Without a stable environment, political unrest, instability, it is impossible to engage in the building of socialism. <br> the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the party, he said, decided to implement the open-door policy, also asked to check the wind of liberalization, which is interrelated issues. Did not check the wind, you can not have open-door policy. Liberalization thought a development, our cause will be red chaos. In short, a goal is to have a stable political environment, stable political environment, it is all not to mention. Govern the country, which is a great truths, must manage many small token. Little reason perhaps justified, but there is no big deal will not work. (Lsjt.org) <br>'
