'cont'=>'April 20 429 years (Baba in early March), mathematician Zu&#39;s birthday. <br> As human into space, more and more detailed understanding of the people on the moon. Today, people have been drawn to detail \"month Figure. In the the moon back of the monthly chart, you can see a mountain marked \"Zuchongzhi birthday. Target =\" _blank \"> Zu mountain of famous mathematicians in our Northern and Southern, the astronomers Zuchongzhi named the Wenyuan. <br> Zu word ancestral home of Fan Yang County Yiqiu County (now Hebei Laiyuan). 429 years April 20 (Southern Dynasties Song Yuanjia six early March 1) (ago 1583), was born in a chamberlain officials home. the Zuchongzhi great contribution to the world science in international enjoyed a high reputation in the mountains on the moon named after him, is a symbol of the <br> Zu grew up smart, studious 20-year-old when school achievement, the Waring School provincial, national research institutes, due to a variety of things, he dared to bold ideas and innovative, practice-oriented, and hardworking, and therefore, in many fields of science has made amazing achievements important contribution to mathematical <br> Zuchongzhi cyclotomic surgery, calculate the ratio of the circumference of diameter between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, this is the first time put forward the most accurate pi an Arab mathematician in the 15th century, was more than he, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter extrapolated to the 17 significant figures, but has Zuchongzhi after 1000 years of the. in Europe, until 1573 Nian (dating back only 439 years), before successively by Otto and Antoine Martinez obtained Zu values &#8203;&#8203;of the operator to not only that, Zu also correctly deduced the formula for the volume of the ball, which is one of the earliest sphere formula he cited principle and 17th century Italian mathematician kava The columns Lee references axiom is consistent with his research <br> Zu&#39;s written a book called \"augmented surgery the book in the first as the Tang dynasty Imperial College\" count by more than 10 books, \"one Unfortunately, to the Northern Song Dynasty as a textbook. later, the book spread to Korea, Japan, also be used as a textbook. (l $ j而.c里) actually lost a. <br> astronomical calendar (history. com) Zuchongzhi at age 33, the preparation of a new calendar called \"Daming calendar Daming calendar\" There are two major changes, one is to break our lineage long 19 years leap \"old leap method. Zuchongzhi after careful projections found this leap method each over 200 years will be a difference of one day. therefore, he broke the traditional concept of repeated calculations accurately draw a every 391 years plus 144 intercalary month of a new leap method. Zuchongzhi first calendar calculation applied precession principle the Eastern Jin astronomers the Yuxi found the so-called precession, the Earth around the sun it orbits, can not be completely back to the original location of the phenomenon. Zuchongzhi application of this principle precisely calculated tropical year is 365.24284481 days with modern scientific measurements compared to the year was only 50 seconds in the history of astronomy and calendar is a major step forward.

(L $ dj而.妨壯T) Zuchongzhi deserves to be one of the greatest scientists in the world. (lssjt.cn) < br>'
