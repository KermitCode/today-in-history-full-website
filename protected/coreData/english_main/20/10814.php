'cont'=>'November 20, 1998 (Tiger years in October, the first two days), the the Sixteen States International Space Station launch. <br> December 7, \"dawn\" cabin \"unity\" cabin space docking success <br> 1998 on November 20, 2010, the United States, Russia, (TodayinHistory.cn) Canada Japan and the European Space Agency is composed of 12 member states of the 16-nation International Space Station is among the first successful launch, which marks the beginning of the human peaceful development of space. The space station is human history&#39;s largest and most advanced manned aircraft, and plans to spend $ 40 billion. <br> 11 20 Moscow time 9:40 northern Kazakhstan&#39;s Baikonur Cosmodrome. \"Bang\" a loud noise, the Russian \"Proton-K\" rocket with a Russian-made functional cargo hold of the main unit of \"Space City\" in a flame and smoke slowly rising, long tail This is a loud noise into space ...... <br> the marks the largest scientific and technological cooperation projects in the field of human space into actual assembly stage; loud noise means human exploration and development of space road and take a step forward a big step. Russia this purpose are proud: 41 years ago, the first artificial Earth satellite in the sky; 37 years ago, the first astronaut, Yuri Gagarin into space; Now, \"space of a new era in Baike Nu Seoul to start. \" <br> this day, over the Baikonur launch site the weather is not ideal, dark clouds obscured reduced visibility, wind speed. Looked at three carrier rocket \"Proton\" top \"dawn\" weighing up to 24 tons of functionality cargo hold, the presence of the hearts of the people are stretched too tightly. Pre-launch, the Russian Space Agency officials have a cautious language. Reference 9 hours 40 minutes, a loud noise, huge launch vehicle puffing brown red flame and smoke where they stand. 40 seconds later, the rocket disappeared into the dense clouds. Control centers, broadcast constantly report to the people on the rocket flight conditions: \"normal flight! \"The flight is normal! 9 minutes and 48 seconds, people see on the screen, \"Dawn\" function cargo hold at an altitude of 200 km, successfully separated from the launch vehicle, and successfully entered orbit. NASA spokesman Kyle - Haining announced: \"The launch vehicle has been out of the &#39;Dawn&#39; No. now rely on their own. \"Junior track rocket of the space will be sent to the apogee 185 km, perigee of 150 km. Four days later, the cabin will draw their own engine rose to a perigee of 350 km, an apogee of 500 km on the preset orbit. <br> 12 7 1 07 points, Russia \"dawn\" cabin \"unity\" cabin about 340 kilometers above the Earth smooth docking. <br> the launch function cargo hold is funded by NASA, the Russian-made. The tank weighs about 20 tons, 13 meters long, the internal volume of 72 cubic meters, the available area of &#8203;&#8203;40 cubic meters, is the space station&#39;s foundation cabin. The space mainly for business class and connection space station habitation module, power, navigation, communications, temperature control and other services for the space station, the headquarters of the space station. The entire space station construction will be completed in 2004, the use of a term of 15 years. However, based on the experience of the Russian \"peace\", the space station&#39;s service period may be extended. the <br> \"Alpha\" space station is completed, the space will appear in a 108 m long, 88 m wide and large-scale \"pyramid\", to become the world&#39;s most advanced scientific research base. The scientists predict that the establishment of the new space station will be possible breakthrough in the development of the world of biology, meteorology, astrophysics, surface detection disciplines. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> the coming of a new era of world aerospace career, but only the first step, a five-year period is just a fleeting moment in the long history, but the \"Alpha & rdquo ; who has a long future, there are many unknowns. <br> Russian aerospace industry from the beginning, there are two completely different views on this project. Some people think this is a revolutionary change in the world aerospace industry, with the moon Quest mentioned in the same breath, the historic significance; another part of this project is a political ad game, will not give science bring a \"principled new knowledge. <br> Russia lose control space dominance due to the implementation of this project, has been publicly opposed to the implementation of the \"Alpha\". The same time, the Russian political, economic, and social situation has so far failed to achieve stability, the next five years and debt peak. This launch by the United States to help make it through, the future of the funds come out? I am afraid that even the president can not answer. Russia assumed Whether 80-10000000000 U.S. dollars is a big unknown. And, in the process of implementation of the project, the actual cost is likely to exceed the original estimate. The International Space Station project named \"Alpha\" <br> is jointly established by the 11 member states of the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Brazil and the European Space Agency&#39;s. 16 countries to carry out such a large-scale cooperation unprecedented international regulations yet to adjust to the \"residents\" of relations within the \"Space Kingdom. \"Alpha\" will be performed within the laws of which country? Russian cosmonaut operating the Japanese Experiment Module mistakes in losses to the space station, will punish what law? National laws conflict how to do? Only this small international legal issues enough jurist headache, not to mention the work, there will be a series of technical problems to be solved. <br> Nevertheless, the rocket carrying the space station aloft, has no escape route, it can only move forward, with a new hope in the world forward.
