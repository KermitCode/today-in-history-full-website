'cont'=>'(Awake, August 15), September 20, 1994, Baosteel No.3 Blast Furnace ignition operation. <br> 1994, 20, 2009, the Baosteel three engineering a large project - Baosteel No.3 Blast Furnace ignition operation on September 20. This is our current volume, the latest technology, the most modern blast furnace. It built, marking China&#39;s large-scale blast furnace design, equipment, manufacturing and construction and installation, has reached the world advanced level. <br> Baosteel No.3 Blast Furnace is our own design, install, a volume of 4350 cubic meters, the annual production capacity of 3.25 million tons of pig iron a large blast. It is under construction on July 15, 1991, the equipment localization rate of 95% or more. -Based Baoshan Iron and Steel Group, Chongqing Iron and Steel Design and Research Institute, Beijing Iron and Steel Design and Research Institute, Beijing automated homes supplemented by shared No.3 Blast Furnace design tasks. Aimed at the goal of a world-class designers, electrical, instrumentation, computer integration center discharge type bell-less top device, pulverized coal injection dozen of the world&#39;s advanced new technology, developed a world-class level of large-scale blast furnace automation application software, (l $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) for the first time with the introduction of technology from Japan and Baosteel own manufacturing the third, the fourth of the cooling wall. No.3 Blast Furnace design life of 12-15 years. <br>'
