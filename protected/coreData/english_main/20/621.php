'cont'=>'(Jiawu the twelfth lunar month XIX), January 20, 1775, the famous French physicist Ampere born. French physicist the <br> Andre Marie Ampere (1775 -1836 on June 10, 2011) ($ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) in the electromagnetic interaction outstanding research achievements, and also contribute to mathematics and chemistry. The current international units of amps that its named after. In 1775, 22, born in Lyon, a wealthy merchant family, died in Marseille on June 10, 1836. 1802 he presided Boolean let - Brace Central school any physics and chemistry professor; 1808 was appointed superintendent of the French Imperial University, has held the post since been; 1814 was elected a member of the Imperial College, Department of Mathematics,; 1819 University of Paris of philosophical lectures; 1824 served as a professor of experimental physics at the College de France.
