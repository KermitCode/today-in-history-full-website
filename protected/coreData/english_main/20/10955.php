The reasons for the outbreak of Soviet missiles in Cuba. This event is seen as the peak of the Cold War and the turning point. Mankind in the history of the world has never been so close to standing on the edge of a nuclear war. <br> throughout the twentieth century, the fifties and sixties, the surging wave of worldwide anti-colonial era, many former colonial or semi-colonial countries became independent. Far in the Caribbean, Cuba, has also undergone a revolution, to overthrow the pro-US traitorous corruption of the Batista regime. Is the famous leader of the revolution Fidel Castro. <br> in the beginning of the victory of the Cuban revolution, did not attract the attention of the world, because in South America has always been in turmoil, coups and revolution continue to occur. Initially the United States trying to win over new Cuban regime continues to take the semi-colonial and semi-road, and hope to continue to maintain the privileges of the United States in Cuba: garrison extraterritoriality, special commercial interests. But the ideals of the Cuban people to build a free and independent Cuba. So the United States began to subvert Cuba&#39;s new regime. <br> 1961, ancient severed diplomatic relations with the United States.

But this is not enough, because Cuba from the United States is only 140 kilometers, 11,000 kilometers away from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union also can not afford to confront the United States in such a distant place. As subsequent history proved that the United States does not have the ability to fight in Vietnam and China, like. <br> Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev face of U.S. nuclear superiority, has been keen to develop rocket nuclear weapons, has been the construction of the conventional forces to take repressive attitude. Therefore, when Khrushchev in the hands of only one card to play - medium-range ballistic missiles.
