'cont'=>'October 13, 2001 (August 27), Government House, our high-performance computer chips, \"Godson\" come out. Reference October 13, 2010, China&#39;s first general-purpose computer central processing unit (CPU) --- \"Godson\" come out. Experts point out that the performance of the \"Godson\" advent \"target =\" _blank \"> Godson\" international chip industry leader Intel Pentium II equivalent but China has full intellectual property rights, the independent development of information technology industry, and national security is of great significance. <br> CPU is the \"heart\" of the computer system. Of the computer market, why, regardless of brand, CPU are from outside, and thus long been known as \"non-core\". <br> Prior to the appraisal meeting held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the experts believe that \"Godson\" CPU architecture design technology reached domestic leading level and international advanced level of technology and hardware system specific dynamic pipeline security support innovation. <br> Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of Li Guojie, said, \"Godson\" chip containing more than 600 million transistors, executable over 250 instructions, using most of the advanced technology in the manufacture of contemporary CPU, and can run Linux and other mainstream operating system and utility software compatible, can withstand a large class of buffer overflow attacks. <br>'
