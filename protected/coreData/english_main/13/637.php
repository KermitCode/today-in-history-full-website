'cont'=>'(Otomi, the twelfth lunar month 19), January 13, 1906, death of Popov, Russian physicist and inventor of the radio. <br> <br> Popov (§¡§Ý§Ö§Ü§ã§Ñ§ß§Õ§â §³§ä§Ö§á§Ñ§ß§à§Ó§Ú§é ¦°§à§á§à§Ó), a Russian physicist, one of the founders of the radio communication. March 16, 1859, was born in the Urals, January 13, 1906 and died in St. Petersburg. (Lsjt.org) 1882 graduated from the University of St. Petersburg, and then employed to schools Lang the Stary have to mine. HR Hertz&#39;s experiments in 1888, the EE Buran Li, France and the United Kingdom OJ Lodge on the metal powder detector study, inspired Popov create electromagnetic waves can be transmitted signals beliefs, made in 1894, a radio receiver. The receiver used by his improved metal powder detector, antenna and receiver for the first time, to improve the sensitivity of the machine. This machine is mainly used for the detection of lightning, it said lightning recorder. May 7, 1895, Popov papers \"metal powder and electric oscillation relationship. Soon, Popov telegraph instead of bells for the receiver terminal, form a complete radio transceiver system. March 24, 1896, Popov and his assistants a brief telegram sent between buildings 250 meters apart. 1897 Stary, Lang was to establish a wireless radio, the same year the summer between 5 km apart two warships in Africa and Europe, No. communication. In early 1900, Popov, radio communication distance to 45 km. To commemorate the outstanding contribution of Popov in radio, in 1945, the Soviet government on May 7 provisions for the radio section of the Soviet Union. <br> 1877, 18-year-old Popov was admitted to the St. Petersburg University Mathematics Department of Physics, and then transfer to the Forest College. There, he developed a wire remote explosives. After the success of the study, the students call him \"explosives expert.\" Popov, 29 years old, Hertz discovered electromagnetic waves the news spread to Russia, he was strongly attracted. He said: \"with all my energy to the installation of lamps just lit up a small corner of the vast Russian; if I can command of electromagnetic waves, can fly over the entire world!\" year, Popov successfully repeated the experiments of Hertz. In a public lecture, he proposed the idea of &#8203;&#8203;using electromagnetic waves of radio communication. In 1894, Popov made a radio receiver, the first time he used on the receiver antenna. It is also the world&#39;s first antenna. <br> 1895, in St. Petersburg, Russian Physical and Chemical Society on the physical branch, Popov read the paper \"the relationship between the metal shavings same electrical oscillations, and the performances of his invention of the radio receiver. After the show, Popov said with confidence: \"Finally, I dare to express a hope that my instrument in further improvement With rapid electrical oscillations for long-distance communication. Decades later, the day was designated as the the radio invention date. Popov papers relevant publications and performances, and immediately attracted the attention of the global academic community. <br> later, Popov telegraph instead of bells, as receiver of the terminal, this device became a radio transmitter. March 24, 1896, the Popov and assistant Leibu Jin at the annual meeting of the Association of Russian Physical Chemistry, [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] formal Morse telegraph code passed by radio performances, the audience than 1,000 people. Performances when the receiver is installed in the conference hall of the Physical Society, the transmitter on nearby forests College Chemistry Building. Leibu Jin keying signal, Popov received signal, the communication distance is 250 meters. He Fuji professor of physics, a branch president of Petro Secretary to each of the telegram received letters written on the blackboard, the last message is: \"Heinrich Hertz. It said Popov reverence The inventor of the electromagnetic wave. This telegram, although very short, only a few words, it is the world&#39;s first wireless telegraphy explicit content. (Today in History www.lssdjt.com) <br> Comments: invention of the radio contribute greatly <br> to'
