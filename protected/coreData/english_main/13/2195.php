'cont'=>'March 13, 1733 (in first month Nianba Guichou), Priestley, British chemist birthday. In In 1733, Joseph Priestley&#39;s Birthday \"target =\" _blank \"> Priestley was born in Yorkshire, England a farm where his father, in addition to the species also processed wool. extraterrestrial Joseph is home to the largest child he like to listen to the work of his father singing at age 4, Joseph has demonstrated extraordinary memory: his father can remember singing, also effortlessly recite lengthy prayers. due to increasing family size, living to make ends meet, as the eldest son Joseph gave aunt Sarah upbringing. aunt&#39;s house affluent life, Joseph does not have to go to work, he can concentrate on school. aunt determined to Joseph trained to be a priest Joseph minded, smart, and very diligent. addition to linguistics, theology, he also read a lot of philosophical works he learned just the age of 20, had a small celebrity. <br> Priestley; engaged in clerical work though life is poor, there is plenty of time for scientific research, he found that their knowledge is confined to philosophy, theology and linguistics, and began to study astronomy, physics and other sciences. the first Priestley interested electrical published two-volume history of electricity, he felt the lack of chemical knowledge, and instead engaged in chemical research. <br> his first air interested and he does not understand why the little mouse a few days in a closed container will die and he was considered for biological breathe pure air was polluted, contaminated air, the organisms will die and he experiments with plants, a potted plant on the cover yard, flower pots placed next to a burning candle to \"air pollution\". candle soon extinguished a few hours, however, the past, the plant was safe. second day , even grow a bud Do plants can purify the air you? <br> Priestley repeated experiments in order to determine whether there are several \"air\". Scientists then called all gas air candle burning animal breathing of carbon dioxide produced is referred to as \"fixed air Priestley proof carbon dioxide can be absorbed by water, forming a solution of Suanwei This is Priestley chemical achievements - made of soda water. because of this invention, he was awarded the highest award - Ke Pulai Medal of the Royal Society. <br> Priestley also proved that plants absorb \"fixed air \"If we let the\" the survival air \"(oxygen), he became the discoverer of plant photosynthesis In future experiments, he also made the nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide , hydrogen fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride, carbon monoxide and other gases. Finally, he put the results of years of research and written a book, \"On the various air Priestley, <br> of gas many experiments are considered human first, he laid the theoretical basis of modern chemistry provides important data, greatly promoted the freedom of thought and experimental science of the 18th century. <br>'
