'cont'=>'In the first two days of October (Yi Chou), November 13, 1985, the completion of China&#39;s first atomic bomb detonation Proving Ground Monument. <br> 1985 11 13, 2009, the completion of China&#39;s first atomic bomb detonation test site monument in Huailai County Garden foot of Yanshan Mountain. The Monday morning <br> 13, took part in the development of the first atomic bomb scientists, engineers and technicians, and the relevant departments, braved the cold wind to come here participated in Jiebei ceremony. The inscription engraved in white marble, wrote: \"the first atomic bomb, the first detonation test site, was founded in February 1960, on April 21 of the same year, started the &#39;first shot&#39;. The venue has been used to early 1964, has provided valuable data for the development of China&#39;s first atomic bomb. Our scientific and technical personnel engaged in the development and testing of nuclear weapons, workers, cadres, the People&#39;s Liberation Army officers and men of the possession of nuclear weapons in our country has achieved a great achievements. \"The stand up <br> and knelt down <br> 40 years ago, a Chinese restaurant in the Chinese district of New York, despite the meager profits, the boss or a request for all service personnel should groveling to the restaurants guests The kneel service. Day every day that passes, they seem to be numb, even habits. However, such a day, the restaurant owner was in tears told his staff, starting today, we no longer need to others knees up! <br> historical freeze in such a moment - October 16, 1964 - This is the Chinese people on the whole earth should never forget the day. This is the Chinese nation no longer need to bow down to the powers of the day, this is the whole world is shocking day for the Chinese people. Because on this day, in the east of the world, in the middle of the continent of Asia, ancient Lop Nur, a group of huge mushroom cloud carrying a nation for centuries not die belief crashing raised a loud noise, just as a moment the course of history of the Chinese nation and the world as a whole must change for the this divine mushroom cloud mass! <br> On this day, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, wrote in his diary: this day has finally come. Now people talk about the moment of China&#39;s return to the United Nations. Because, according to the history of hundreds of years of colonialism of the Western powers train robber logic, this world is based on the strength of the division. If the Korean War, so the powers really aware of the inevitable rise of the people of China; then it is in that group mushroom cloud rises so that the whole world was shocked to see: a long-suffering, going through the ups and downs of a great nation with a new attitude re- step into the ranks of world power. <br> However, the people at the time seemed to intentionally or unintentionally ignored this fact: The successful development of the atomic bomb, in the extreme sinister, even difficult to survive under conditions with an indomitable and unyielding conviction and the will to overcome all difficulty has been completed. No country in the world to our China, starting from nothing wasteland to independently develop their own strategic industries; without which a country&#39;s sophisticated technology staff even want to go hungry in the world, swollen legs work; World on which a country&#39;s senior technical personnel willing to lifelong anonymity, even lose the right to publish any of an academic. However, in the sixties, the anti-China forces in the United States and the Soviet Union, the two superpowers headed in crazy era China sanctions and blockade, the hero of the Chinese people will become a reality this miracle. <br> look back on that period of history, people are still excited when we can not help but be amazed at the nuclear weapons research course extreme hardships and generous tragic, its so we can not but admire Chairman Mao Zedong, the late leader of the Chinese people and the vision and foresight of the older generation of revolutionaries led by Premier Zhou Enlai groups. <br> Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou profoundly know: if not a loud noise, then the international status of the Chinese nation is out of the question; begging for alms and gifts of foreigners, is always unable to grasp the key core technology. For this reason, they are in the case of that kind of suffering, and resolutely reject negative proposition to abandon the development of nuclear technology directly from the CPC Central Committee and the internal dauntless courage, decided to walk the road of self-reliance. <br>: History has proven that is their wise decision before China&#39;s rapidly become an important nuclear power, greatly improving the overall national strength and international status, effectively inspire the national spirit, and enhance the sense of pride and mission of the entire Chinese nation sense. Moreover, the nuclear industry is directly contributing to the industry&#39;s rapid development of a number of related technologies to upgrade the level of modernization of China&#39;s science and technology, nothing being blaze the path of the development of a national strategic industry. Can imagine, \"Had to give up nuclear weapons development view prevailed, the ROC has also in the national arena as an insignificant role in it? <br>'
