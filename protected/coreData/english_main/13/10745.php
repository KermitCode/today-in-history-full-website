'cont'=>'November 13, 1986 (Bingyin October 12), the internationally controlled nuclear fusion research to the opening of the International Conference. 13-20 <br> 1986 11, (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m), chaired by the International Atomic Energy Agency Eleventh Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research International Conference held in Kyoto, Japan. <br> Tokamak fusion device, the United States, Japan, the European Economic Community, the researchers published research report caused widespread attention of the participants. Tokamak type nuclear fusion device is heated to more than 1 million degrees of light elements, such as deuterium and tritium, the nuclei and electrons into the plasma state, and with the magnetic field will be constrained in the ring-type vacuum vessel, causing a nuclear fusion reaction, while generating huge amounts of energy. Controlled nuclear fusion fuel - deuterium large number exist in the sea water, can be said to be inexhaustible, controlled nuclear fusion produce nuclear scientists seen as the most promising energy. <br> Currently, three large tokamak fusion test device ongoing critical plasma conditions (temperature of 100 million degrees, the confinement time of 1 second, 50 trillion cubic centimeter of neutron density in the world a) of the test. Three large tokamak plasma test device in Japan \"JT-60\", \"TFTR\" of the United States and the European Community \"JET\". The IAEA of the European Communities, the scientists said in the report, the JET test device in the test has made the critical plasma three conditions, namely the temperature reaches more than 100 million degrees Celsius, the magnetic field confinement time is 0.6 seconds, 1 cc neutron number density 25000000000000. U.S. scholars said in the report, \"TFTR\" test device test, the temperature reached more than 100 million, the confinement time of 0.15 seconds, the neutron number density of 30 trillion. The report of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, said, \"JT-60\" test device in a short period of time to achieve continuous operation. Japan \"JT-60\" means the high frequency heating means is heated by electromagnetic wave plasma, and capture of the difficulties of continuous operation in a short time using this method. Japan, the United States, the European Community, published research results show that the Tokamak fusion device, Tokamak fusion device has achieved initial results also show that forward to the practical stage of the Tokamak fusion reactor a step further. (On 43 TodayOnHistory.com) <br> Japan, the United States, Western European countries, China, the Soviet Union and other countries and regions, more than 700 institutions fusion researchers and scholars attended the meeting. <br>'
