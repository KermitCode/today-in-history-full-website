'cont'=>'June 24 (Government House), August 13, 2001, Koizumi insisted on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine expressed strong indignation among the people of Asia. <br> Koizumi regardless of opposition in World War II&#39;s visit to the Yasukuni Shrine <br> Korean families of the victims to protest Koizumi&#39;s visit <br> Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, ignoring the objections to the domestic and international public opinion in Japan, on the afternoon of August 13, 2001 paid homage Ji Shrine of Class A war criminals. Prior to that, he was a statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, reads as follows: August 15 <br> our country will usher in the first 56 Armistice Day. Standing in the beginning of the 21st century, recalling the wars of the last century, it is difficult to suppress the heart of the solemn feelings. During that war, Japan brought grave disaster to the people of many countries of the world, including our national. Asian neighbors in the past period of time, based on false national policy of colonial rule and aggression, to impose the hurt and pain that they are difficult to calculate. Difficult to heal the trauma has left many people in the victim. (History today www.lssdjt.com) <br> here, I humbly acknowledge the history of our people remorse, would like to offer my deep sorrow for all the victims of the war, while in deep introspection. <br> I think that our country can no longer repeat the mistakes of the war. Once again, I feel the peace and prosperity in Japan today is built on top of their noble sacrifice led me to re-issued every year to make peace standing before you souls who still believe that the future of our country in difficult times and died on the battlefield, oath. I think, if I fully explained my belief, will get the understanding of the people of our country and neighboring countries, and also shows that the desire to want to visit the Yasukuni Shrine on Aug. 15 after I became prime minister. <br> However, as Armistice Day approaching, at home and abroad on my visits to the Yasukuni Shrine in non-voice talk more and more. Not only from domestic opposition voices to stop visiting abroad. Under this situation, if I deny Armistice Day on the results of the shrine with my intention to lead at home and abroad to reject war on Japan, the emphasis on the basic idea of &#8203;&#8203;peace with suspicion, never I hope. Therefore, I sincerely accept the requirements at home and abroad, and to make my own decisions: to evade paying homage on the anniversary day, visits to the Yasukuni elect Date. the <br> recover as Prime Minister of a country has made the statement, I am ashamed matter to. However, whether or not I adhere consistently advocated for the Shrine, and now I must be on the basis of the interests of the country as a whole, wholehearted efforts to fulfill the duties of the Prime Minister, to solve the problems faced by Japan. <br> If circumstances permit, I will as soon as possible to look for opportunities and important leaders of China and South Korea sincere talks on the future of peace and development of the Asia Pacific region to exchange views and to clarify my above belief. (On TodayOnHistory.com) <br> In addition, the next problem is, it is necessary to discuss how to respect the National Shrine Chidorigafuchi tomb Court of the war dead are pregnant feelings, so our war dead the memorial service at home and abroad understand. <br> I deeply hope that citizens can understand my sincere feelings. <br>'
