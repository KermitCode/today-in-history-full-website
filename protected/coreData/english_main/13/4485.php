'cont'=>'May 13, 1964 (Jiachen April two days), the American astronomer Peng Israel and Wilson the measured isotropic radiation into space. <br> 1964, 13, the American astronomer Peng Israel and Wilson in the space of isotropic radiation measured at a wavelength of 7.35 cm. Afterwards, 1 mm to 21 cm radio wavelengths, as well as observations on the X and gamma-ray band to this phenomenon. This phenomenon was later named as the cosmic background radiation is one of the four major discovery in the 1960s astronomy. The cosmic background radiation is interpreted as the residual radiation from the primordial fireball its corresponding redshift value of approximately 3000.
