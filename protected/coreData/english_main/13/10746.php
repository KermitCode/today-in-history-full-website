'cont'=>'November 13, 1989 October 16 (Baba), the world&#39;s largest electron-positron collider completed. <br> 1989 11 13, the world&#39;s largest particle accelerator - Europe \"Levin splashed\" electron-positron collider build the plan to the Executive Director Amy Ferrie ¡¤ Pika Suo professor in the the machine official inauguration will be the key to the the CERN main Xikaerluo Rubbia Professor. <br> \"Levin splashed\" Electron-Positron Collider located in an underground tunnel in France and Swiss borders Jura Yamashita. This tunnel of 50 to 150 meters and a diameter of 3.8 meters, 27,000 meters circumference. It can simulate the scene of the universe in the hundreds of millions of years ago, a large explosion Electron Positron Collider follow the opposite direction, running speed of light, collided. By scientists to observe the impact of the electron-positron new phenomenon, to explore the basic structure of matter, uncover the mystery of the birth of the universe. <br> \"Levin splashed\" began in 1983, the construction works of the collider build that plan approved by the European Organization for Nuclear Research Center after two years. The entire project was completed in July 1989, a total cost of 1.3 billion Swiss francs. <br> 3-week experimental results show that, \"Levin splashed the maximum energy of the particle accelerator can reach over 100 billion electron volts, and mass production of the\" Z \"particles for scientists to study the quality of the particle itself, life , decay properties, further understanding of the basic law of the movement of the universe. At the ceremony, <br> CERN Director, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics Rubbia Dr. pointed out, \"Levin splashed machine running the European Organization for Nuclear Research Center, 14 European member states united, the result of efforts. It marked the basic research in particle physics in Europe a leading position. \"Levin splashed machine built European scientists and scientists around the world the product of many years of cooperation in a total of more than 1,500 people, including scientists from China, the United States and the Soviet Union and other countries. <br>'
