'cont'=>'October 13, 1998 (August 23) Tiger years, the Chinese-American Daniel C. Tsui was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. <br> Chinese-American Daniel C. Tsui received the Nobel Prize in Physics \"target =\" _blank \"> Daniel C. Tsui was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics <br> 1998 10 13, 2009, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded to Americans Robert ﹞ B ﹞ Laughlin, the the German Horst Shituo Mo and Chinese-American Professor Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University in the United States, in recognition of their discovery of the fractional quantum electrons in strong magnetic fields of the Hall effect. sixth place after Chen Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) Samuel Ting, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) Yuan T. Lee, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) Steven Chu Nobel Science Award of Chinese scientists. <br> Royal Academy communique said Shi Tuomo and Daniel C. Tsui 1982 discovered this phenomenon in a powerful magnetic field and low temperature experiment. A year later, Laughlin theory explains above two findings. finding people to further understanding of the general structure of the substance and nature of great significance. contribution of three scientists make new breakthrough quantum physics, and promote the important modern physics development of theoretical concepts. <br> Daniel C. Tsui, born in 1939 in Henan, has been into the American citizen, PhD in Physics of the University of Chicago in 1967, 1982, he was appointed professor at Princeton University in 1984, he won the American Physical Society awarded Oliver Berkeley Prize (L $ dj而.c身m) 1998 also won the world famous Benjamin Franklin Prize in Physics In Laughlin in 1950 was born in California in 1979, the Massachusetts Institute of Physics Ph.D., professor at Stanford University in 1989, he was appointed In Shi Tuomo 1949 Born in Frankfurt, Germany, PhD in Physics at the University of Stuttgart in 1977, the work Bell Laboratories in the United States since 1992 (L $ dj而. c身m) and served as a professor at Columbia University in December 1998, he was a reporter interviewed him to talk about the scholarship should live: <br> Daniel C. Tsui, \"to be successful, there must be a certain amount of luck and timing, but the hard work is foundation. \"He said to him every year with twenty or thirty graduate students, they are very hard, others tend to the time spent on the ball spent in the lab, days a week, a day&#39;s work 10-12 hours is often some things. <br> average person seems that physics is boring, is not easy results, compared with the study of law and business people, but also do not earn a lot of money. Professor Cui own opinion he thinks, engage physics research, as long as the input, it will interesting, every time a new discovery, even if it is very tiny discovery also enjoy a lot of fun. <br> Cui Qi also said that to be successful, do not be affected by the surrounding environmental impact, \"To believe in yourself, believe in your own ability,\" I often encourage students to look to the future, believe he was involved in is useful to the cause of humanity. \"he said,\" if only for a three meals a day, do not need to do research, engage in simple manual labor, is needed to achieve the purpose of the scholarship is not for the money, but in order to be useful to others. \"<br> Cui Qi pointed out, believe in yourself , we must also believe that others only open your mind to others, will win the trust and help of others to do it away from their homeland to a foreign country to study Chinese people is particularly important, because they have to bear than greater pressure for others, if you can not close with the people around, it is easy to fall into the isolated <br> Cui Qi talked about his first-class students from prestigious universities in China, said, \"they have a very good test scores, but I told them that the scholarship is not homework, something that simply repeat their predecessors did. \"He hit a metaphor, like to find his way home in the wilderness or forest, you need to have the pioneering spirit of exploration . <br> Cui Qi like \"just wanted to contribute, but not to receive\" motto, and this year won the Nobel Prize for years of hard work and sweat in exchange for a bumper harvest, a reporter asked how he felt about this harvest, Cui Professor faint smile does not directly answer the question, he said he will, as usual, taught at Princeton University for his book, immersed in the study of physics, because it is the world that he was a great sport. <br>'
