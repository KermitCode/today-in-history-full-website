'cont'=>'August 13, 1958 (June 28), the Reform Movement, put the satellite Hubei macheng rice yield. <br> see rice grow so dense, the kids like standing on the sofa <br> According August 13, 1958 \"People&#39;s Daily\" reported: <br> \" Macheng County early rice production and blossomed. Joint inspection confirmed that the three group of early rice yield acceptance of Hubei Province, Huanggang Area and Macheng County, the county&#39;s Ma River Township, the founding of the first agricultural community, one one six acres of Jiangxi early \"seed sowing Waseda average per-mu yield the dry valleys thirty-six thousand nine hundred fifty-six pounds, creating an amazing record, as of now, this is a &#39;champion&#39; in a bumper harvest of early rice in China emitted a large number of high-yielding &#39;Satellite&#39; The early rice yield record than Anhui Province, Gao Feng, of Zongyang Shima Township Agricultural Society and the County Pingjing, Township Agricultural Society has created more than twice. The people did not dare to think \"<br>\" early rice yield record, give full play to the communist style of bold and innovative achievements. It is understood that this piece of Tin site preparation up to ten times, deep plowing up to more than a foot. Total base fertilizer dressing five successively applied fertilizer meter grass seeds three extremely heavy, pond scum $ 10 quintals four hundred quintals, Chen brick earth, ammonium sulfate, one hundred and five pounds superphosphate jin water manure 60 Tam, soybean hundred jin. Base fertilizer combined plowing layered application, done layers fertilizer. The density of planting, in fact, has been very difficult with the number of stump to calculate, because rice is one of the block of fields close to one. Acceptance, the people had selected an area of &#8203;&#8203;one square foot measured It is the measured projected that an average of about 7.68 million per acre spike. Eggs lightly on Puffs above to scroll the eggs always does not fall into the fields to. Visible piece Tian Wo secret to what extent. The <br> to procure piece Tian yield measures gradually clear beginning, the people of deep plowing, fertilizer enough and close planting there are some doubts, so only plow seven inches deep, less fertilizer, close planting only done ZhuJu inch, spaced four inches. About a month after planting, emerging around the wheat yield miracle, the per-mu yield reached more than 50 jin has many, this is a great encouragement for people to cultivate this experimental field. They said: &#39;yield of 7,500 kilos of wheat, rice million kilograms per mu, why can not it? &#39;They are determined to engage in more high high yield trials kilograms per mu, and take the appropriate measures, which is to deepen the tilth, enough fertilizer to increase the density. At this time, the seedlings grow to a foot tall, but they still decided to put these seedlings pull up, a plow, a rake, a Chao (soil whole crushing), so that the plow layer depth of one foot, and Adding fertilizer, then again Honda seedlings and a few acres of seedlings, with the plant to this field, the formation of a number hard to stump height close planting, because seedlings grow extremely dense, impossible Shimoda, to field management brought many difficulties, but people with collective wisdom to overcome it. For example, to dressing, but fertilizer but also how under less than mud go, they&#39;ll just around the fields ditching pipes to irrigation water and fertilizer to the fields. They also fight stays the way to prevent back like, made to the drought and continue to struggle. \"<br>'
