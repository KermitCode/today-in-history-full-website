'cont'=>'June 18 (Gengwu years), July 13, 1930, the opening of the first World Cup. In In 1930, 13 the Uruguay National Day centenary two years ago won the reason to become the first session of the World Cup (the host of the opening of the first World Cup), and eventually got his wish to become the championship <br> FIFA held the World Football Championship resolution response of most countries, and widely welcomed by the people, and this has created favorable conditions for the first session of the World Football Championship held. But the organization of a world, all countries can participate in the tournament, after all, is not an easy thing. For example, on a range of issues of game time, location and race, to go through the detailed and thorough consideration, to enable all participants were able to compete under the same conditions, to compete for the title of world champion. <br> held the first session of the World Football Championship, the first encounter is to choose the venue. Had held in a European country, the first session of the World Football Championship grand, warm and much more;, but the Uruguayans adhere held in the capital Montevideo, the FIFA World without sufficient reasons to reject them this requirements of Uruguay in the recent Olympic Games two consecutive football title (1924,1928) them is recognized football powerhouse in the world, if they did not participate in the First World Football Championship will lose radiance, reduce level. In addition, in 1930, a time when Uruguay independent centennial, this is also an important reason. Therefore, the competition will take place on selected. <br> go to Uruguay, there are many difficulties for the European team, the road is far more funding, more important is to draw out the best athletes from their game for a long time, affect the income of professional clubs, so many countries are not willingness to participate in the registration of only four teams in Belgium, Romania, Yugoslavia, France. South American teams based on their geographic convenience, the participation of seven teams in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay. , (On TodayOnHistory.com) North America, Mexico and the United States. Looking back, a total of thirteen teams, how to play it, the Olympic Games in the traditional way (knock-out) must be sixteen teams, robin system competition fair and reasonable, but the game time is too long, which at the time is not allowed. Finalize a compromise, thirteen teams divided into four groups, each team in the group game round-robin system, the team first team the right to enter the semi-finals, semi-finals and finals out of the system. The way to determine <br> game after thirteen teams how to group it? balloting? such strong teams likely to be concentrated in a group, of course, unreasonable. Row seedings? Seem too subjective. Later decided to Europe four teams separated South America, the \"top three\" - Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, separately from the other teams assigned to each team balloting. In addition to the first group of four teams, the other three groups are the three teams. <br> first team: France, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. In this group, the most notable of Argentina, because of their South American football championship game on the achievements in the Olympic Games is very prominent, but he almost give the team championship to French team, in which two teams the game, the Frenchman performances are excellent, advancing fast, tenacious will to fight, giving a great threat to the Argentines. Unfortunately, a French players injured leave the field became 11 individuals of 10 individual competitions. Argentina in the case of the number of dominant until the end of the game will be when it finally hit the only ball of the match victory over France. Frenchman&#39;s another game did not show the expected standards (lost 0-1 to Chile), but the French team still enjoys a high reputation in world football, Argentina beat the other two opponents easily ( 6:3 wins Mexico, wins 3:1 Chile), they have the right to obtain a semi-final. <br> second group: Yugoslavia, Brazil, Bolivia. The team broke the \"unpopular\", the Yugoslav team unobtrusive 2:1 Lectra Brazil, Youyi 4: O victory over Bolivia, the team first. This is to participate in the semi-finals only European teams. The (Lssdjt.com) <br> third group: Romania, Uruguay, Peru. And anticipate, twice Olympic Games football competition winner - Uruguay easily achieved victory. 4: O wins Romania 1:0 wins Peru. This after the game, a single point of view from the score, is the lowest figure in the victory, but we all know that the score often not a true reflection of the relative strength of the two teams, this time is also true. Uruguayan advantage in the race is very obvious. fourth <br> group: Belgium, United States, Paraguay, the United States team: O the same score, easily defeated Paraguay and Belgium made the team first. This is far beyond the expectations of the people, because they then football and Europe is still in its infancy. Olympics in Amsterdam two years ago, they have a less honorable record - 2:11&#39;s score was eliminated. Actually occurred two years after such a big change, and why the U.S. team to progress so fast? Look at their list of players will reveal the secret. The original Americans in order to participate in this tournament, from the United Kingdom \"imported\" many of the best professional football players, and for them to apply for a U.S. citizenship, wearing the England national football team of American sportswear with the last Olympics, the United States soccer team a big difference. <br> semi-finals, due to the strength difference is too big not described, Argentina and Uruguay have defeated their opponents score of 6:1 in the United States and Yugoslavia. Central and South America and in the world&#39;s major game prevailed, and the tournament finals and finals of two years ago, the Olympic football matches, Argentina, Uruguay, the two old rivals met again. <br> final day, travel to Montevideo, Argentina audience, shouting \"victory or death\" slogan flock.
