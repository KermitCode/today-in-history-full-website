'cont'=>'September 13, 1995 August 19 (Otsugase years), \"863\" Pacific expedition team returned to Beijing. <br> national \"863 Program\" the Pacific scientific investigation flowers thicket and applause from the evening of the 13th returned to Beijing. The expedition team this trial <br> visits starting in mid-July this year. After nearly two months of wrestling with the storms, the top summer antihalation overcome many difficulties for sea trials, the joint efforts of the dozens of experts, the successful completion of the \"863 plan\" a major scientific research \"ocean floor detection system \"The test tasks. (Lssdjt.com) <br> ocean floor detection system using a variety of specialty materials made with water communications, high-pressure sealing, signal acquisition, autonomous navigation control and power supply capacity, is not a substitute for other detection equipment . At present, the world only a few countries have the ability to develop the kind of the world&#39;s most advanced ocean floor detection equipment. <br> The test shows that China&#39;s ocean floor detection system has the ability to be able to detailed probing the waters of the world except the trench outside 97% of the total area of &#8203;&#8203;the oceans. The United Nations has approved 150,000 square kilometers of exploration exclusive ocean floor for polymetallic nodules in the Pioneer Area resources. China&#39;s expedition team, in this trial, the use of the ocean floor detection means of advanced technology, some of the information collected. result of of <br> this test more than 10 times the original targets of the \"863 Program\", reached the scheduled 2000 completion target. This indicates that China has a strong technical means, a major step in the development of marine resources in the 21st century. Development of this system has a lot of scientific and technical personnel, especially young scientists to participate in research. The visit, there are two women scientists to participate, are also rare. <br>'
