'cont'=>'December 13, 134 years (Awake in the winter in early j) developed by Zhang Heng seismograph observations to the earthquake the Longxi Beijing no sense. In December 13, In 134 years, Zhang Heng seismograph developed observed no sense of the earthquake Longxi (now Gansu Tianshui area) capital (now Luoyang, Henan Province). the <br> \"taste Long hair dryer while unknowingly moving, capital scholars, salty strange to its levy. A few days after relay to If earthquake Longxi \". Longxi earthquake from 132 AD to 139 Zhang Heng died, historical records only once, on March 1, 138 years, \"the capital and Jincheng, Longxi earthquake\" (see the \"Han Shundi Ji\" page 267) Many authors mistakenly the earthquake and Zhang Heng seismograph corresponding, in fact, move this entry measured by seismograph earthquake Longxi \", capital\" to feel \"does not meet, so the experts think is not the same as an earthquake, Some speculate that the Han of Shundi Yang Jia Sannian (AD 134) a moderate earthquake records Unknown. <br> Luoyang thin rod tilting to the people nor feeling, Luoyang minimum intensity should triple to four degrees. Fortunately, history had 4 times with the same intensity in Luoyang, the epicenter located in the the Longxi near earthquake historical data available for comparison: 1879 (8), Wen County, Gansu, 1718 the Gansu tongwei (7), 1709 Gansu Zhongwei (7), the 1654 earthquake in Tianshui, Gansu (8). It follows that, Longxi earthquake seismograph corresponding seven epicentral intensity should be above 10 degrees, and the Shanbengdelie loss is severe, affected vast areas of Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei County, will be documented. Due to the Eastern Han Longxi, Tianshui strong earthquake has been recorded, such as AD, 93 years, 97 years, 123 years, 128 years, 138 years, 143 years strong earthquake. However, historical data does not have this earthquake. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> comments: \"experience things together deed if God. \"Can even be measured in thousands of miles away in Luoyang, no one felt the earthquake <br>'
