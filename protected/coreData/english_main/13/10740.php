'cont'=>'(Gengshen October sixth days), November 13, 1980, the U.S. spacecraft Voyager 1 crossed Saturn. Saturn&#39;s rings <br> charm <br> 1980 November 13, 2010, the U.S. spacecraft Voyager 1 124.237 km from Saturn passing Saturn. Departed Saturn in the 20th region, continue to fly in the solar system. The spacecraft weighs one ton, the use of atomic energy is not manned. It is automatically sent back to the flight of the Saturn near over 10,000 color photos of Saturn and its rings and satellites and a variety of data, including some of the new discovery enabled scientists by surprise. Some scientists say that in the past weeks, we get knowledge about Saturn, even more than in the entire history of mankind. <br> past that formal show of Saturn&#39;s six aura in space. \"Voyager 1\" field detection through this, found it to be much more complex than originally know. There are hundreds, even thousands of rings of different sizes, they are mostly symmetrical around the Saturn ring plane. Looks like LP corrugated. However, some non-symmetry. Their shapes are some serrated, some radial. Some of them are clear lines, some smooth and well-proportioned. The most scientists puzzled some ring like braids kink. The scientists believe that this obviously can not be explained by the theory of orbital mechanics, there may be in addition to the gravitational force. [Lsjt.net] <br> this detection results show that: the Saturn ring is composed of numerous fine particles composed of a diameter of between 7.6 cm to 9 meters, at great speeds around Saturn operation. Also found that these particles are conductive body, and can emit radio signals, up to millions of watts of power. This process seems to be similar to the process of thunderstorms that produce the same on Earth. detection <br> \"Voyager One\" also proved, Saturn&#39;s moon - Titan unlike the past, people considered as the largest satellite in the solar system, its diameter is only 4828 km, while Jupiter the satellite - Ganymede diameter is 5150 km, Titan had relegated to the second. <br> Titan is currently known in the solar system, only the atmosphere of the satellite in the past that its atmosphere is mainly consisting of methane, but this time found that the composition of Titan&#39;s atmosphere is mainly nitrogen, accounting for about 98% methane is less than 1%. Also contains a small amount of ethane, ethylene, acetylene and hydrogen. the <br> scientists discovered infrared detection data from Voyager One, Titan&#39;s cloud tops with life-related molecules, scientists believe it is likely to produce life before the hydrocyanic acid molecules. But this does not mean that life Titan. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> Titan&#39;s atmospheric thickness of about 2700 km, the atmospheric temperature of 201 degrees Celsius. As the temperature is low, the nitrogen in its atmosphere may be a liquid state, forming the surface of the satellite liquid nitrogen lakes. <br> Titan is like a power plant, it is out radio waves emitted voltage up to 6000 volts, a power of 20,000 watts. It is believed that this is a result of the interaction between the ionosphere and the magnetic field. <br>'
