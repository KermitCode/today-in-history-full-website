'cont'=>'(, Xinwei In May fifth), June 16, 1991, the United States made a substitute for human blood. <br> American DNX company announced on June 16, 1991, scientists from the company&#39;s successful cultivation of a change of the growth gene of swine carry human hemoglobin in their blood. The company&#39;s clinical trial applications will be presented to the U.S. authorities, in order to determine the security of this blood substitute to enter the human body. <br> this company in Princeton, New Jersey, said, for nurturing such a pig, they first remove the insemination only one day embryo injected two groups can produce human hemoglobin gene, and then the embryo is implanted other pigs. Piglets obtained by this genetic engineering, only three carries human hemoglobin. Currently scientists are bacteria, yeast, China insects and other mammals, the manufacture of a substitute for human blood. While DNX was chosen pigs, the main reason is similar to the pig hemoglobin and human hemoglobin, and gene replacement pigs will not cause side effects, in addition, porcine reproductive rate, rapid growth. <br>'
