'cont'=>'October 16, 1988 (, Boshin September sixth days), the Beijing Electron Positron Collider collision. <br> Beijing Electron Positron Collider collision successful \"target =\" _blank \"> Electronic Collider In the early morning of October 16, 1988, 56 minutes (Today in History www.TodayOnHistory. com) China&#39;s first high-energy accelerator - Beijing Electron Positron Collider for the first time successfully collision this is China&#39;s second atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, after the satellite into space, in the high-tech field is another major breakthrough achievements . <br> Beijing Electron-Positron Collider is the high-tech project of the construction of the CPC Central Committee and State Council decision. including electron injection, the four major components of storage ring, detectors and data processing centers, synchrotron radiation area, complex systems engineering by the hundreds, thousands of pieces of sophisticated special equipment it built and successfully hit, opened up broad prospects for application of particle physics and synchrotron radiation research opened our high-energy new chapter in physics research. <br> this is considered to be the largest research project in the history of Chinese science and technology (on TodayOnHistory.com) Comrade Deng Xiaoping laid the foundation stone on October 7, 1984 broke ground for 4 years organization and command of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council entrusted the Beijing Electron Positron Collider project leading group fruitful, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences with the center more than 10 ministries and belongs hundreds of factories, research institutes, colleges and universities nearly 10,000 scientific and technical personnel, workers, cadres, PLA officers and men, promoting self-confidence, the spirit of self-reliance, self-improvement, and fully absorb the advanced technology in the world, self-reliance, hard work, tenacious struggle to overcome the difficulties an outstanding job in their own design, development , production, installation, commissioning tasks and create construction speed, investment, good quality and high level of miracle to Beijing to attend the meeting of the Sino-US high-energy cooperation said Professor Li Zhengdao, the Beijing Electron Positron Collider successful collision a major event for the international high-energy physics community in just four years to complete such a complex high-tech engineering, not such a fast speed in the international can once hit successfully, to show that the various collider quality of the kinds of equipment, components, installation and commissioning of the level in the world is also a first-class <br> According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences say Beijing Electron Positron Collider National Laboratory of opening up to the outside world will be built into future, according to both the characteristics of the application of particle physics and synchrotron radiation research, it will become a cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary experimental research base enjoyment. <br>, the experts of the Institute of High Energy Physics is continuing preparations debugging and physical experiments in order to continuously improve the stability of a variety of devices, and brightness indicators meet the design requirements as soon as possible, and to make a meaningful physical experiment. <br>'
