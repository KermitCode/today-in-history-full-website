'cont'=>'November 16, 1957 (September 25) Ding, the Soviet Union built the world&#39;s first gas-power. <br> 1957 11 16, 2009, that a coal underground gasification gas as a power in the world&#39;s first gas turbine power stations, (history today www.lssdjt.com) built in the Moscow suburbs. <br> this new type of power station sites share is not large, but its fuel base is very broad. Fuel base in the ground 40 meters below, where burning coal seam, spray a lighted amazing fierce flame temperature reaches 1,000 degrees. People use a variety of specialized instruments to manipulate the process of combustion of the fuel on the ground. Hour over forty thousand cubic meters of gas shun gas pipe from the underpass to the combustion chamber. The geologists determined, power stations rely on coal seam reserves reached 5,000 tons, with a seven-years-old. (History cn a) <br> plant&#39;s first turbine generating capacity of twelve thousand kilowatts, which is based on the jet principle work. Minimize the loss of fuel and energy are taken into account in the establishment of the entire complex equipment systems. The power of the gas turbine unit is much higher than the thermal power stations, and the management personnel of the machine can be reduced to two-thirds. <br>'
