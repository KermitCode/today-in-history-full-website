Reduce the two million barrels of daily oil imports in the United States, many factories so as to close the lay-off, is plagued by the energy crisis, the U.S. government had declared the country in a \"state of emergency\" and adopted a series of oil and electricity savings emergency measures, including: the reduce flights voyage, speed limits, and heating oil rationing, close stations nationwide on Sunday, prohibitions and restrictions on outdoor lighting advertising.

Arab people through this struggle, political elated further awakening awareness into their own hands that effective force uniforms imperialism had been, they are determined to control their own resources, their own control their own destiny. <br> petroleum struggle greatly enhance the economic strength of the Arab countries. Only raise prices one of the Arab country&#39;s oil revenues by $ 30 billion in 1973, soared to $ 110 billion in 1974, greatly inspired the struggle of the people of the Third World to defend national sovereignty and the protection of the interests of the national economy, it is Third World countries against imperialism and colonialism and hegemonism has created a new situation. <br>'
