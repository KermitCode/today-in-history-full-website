'cont'=>'May 16, 1787 (March 29) DingWei, German physicist Ohm&#39;s birthday. In In 1787, Ohm was born in Erlangen in Bavaria. Ohm&#39;s father was a skilled locksmith, philosophy and mathematics are very loving. Ohm&#39;s Birthday \"target =\" _blank \"> ohm childhood learning in the father&#39;s education mathematical and training by mechanical skills, this research work, especially his later homemade instrument of great help. (Lssjt.cn) < ; br> 1805 years, Ohm entered the Irish University learning, and later forced out of school because of family financial difficulties, through self-study, (history com) in 1811, he again returned to Ireland to obtain a doctorate After graduating from college, Ohm maintained by teaching life. since 1820, he began to study electromagnetism <br> ohm research work is carried out under very difficult conditions, he is not only busy with teaching and library materials and instruments were scarce, he can only use his spare time, do-it-yourself design and manufacture of instrumentation for experimental 1826 ohm discovered an important law of electricity - Ohm&#39;s law, which is his greatest contribution us today, this law seems very simple, however, it found that the process is not as simple as most people imagine. [1 $ dj而.c身m] ohm to pay a very arduous labor in that era, the current strength the concept of voltage, resistance, etc. are not sure about, especially the concept of resistance has not, of course, they did not mention them accurate measurements; Moreover the ohm himself in the course of his research, but also almost no chance to talk with him era physicist contact This finding is independent. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) the initial test <br> ohm study the strength of various wire conductivity with The various conductor to observe the deflection angle of the needle. Later in the trial the change in the electromotive force on the circuit, he found that the dependencies between the electromotive force and resistance, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) This is the Ohm&#39;s law this law can be two forms: First, the part of the circuit of Ohm&#39;s law, the current through the parts of the circuit is equal to the part of the circuit the voltage across the resistor divided by the part of the circuit; two full circuit Ohm&#39;s law, i.e. the current through the closed circuit , equal to the power of the force in the circuit, divided by the total resistance of the circuit. <br> Ohm&#39;s law and its formula found, brought a lot of convenience to the calculation of electricity to commemorate him, the unit of resistance as ohms, referred to as \"Europe\". research was originally published in <br> ohms, did not arouse the attention of the scientific community, and attacked by some people, and until 1841, the Medal of the Royal Society awarded ohms to Ke Pule ohm work has been universally recognized Ke Pule Award is the highest honor in the scientific community in July 1854, (l $ j而.c里) ohms Man Naxi passed away in Germany. <br>'
