The postwar Allied generals commented, Hitler click staggering quasi Eisenhower at that time so see: Allied afford to make any large-scale attack in Antwerp did not fix before. <br> to seize Antwerp, it is necessary to break through the Allied line of defense, Hitler to his habit of thinking, a phase of an old place, and this is the Ardennes. <br> Ardennes since ancient times for the China-EU strategic location, it is in the southeast of Belgium, Luxembourg in the north and the northeast of France, an area of &#8203;&#8203;about 10,000 square kilometers. Because here more than the forest, also known as the Ardennes forest, Nazi Germany had used this strategic location, line of defense of the French army, suddenly out of army tanks in the Ardennes breakthrough in June 1940, off the Antwerp Allied posterior, resulting in Dunkirk retreat and the French surrender.

Since late autumn, he \"Griffin plans look everywhere for the remnants of more than pawn, actually put together more than 2,000 vehicles new or modified tank, concentrated after the force of 34 divisions. Goering also promised to Couchu 3000 aircraft. <br> At such times, the Allied high command is doing what? Nothing to do. Western military history scientist in finishing this period the Allied high command file, found in an embarrassing letter, letter Eisenhower wrote to Montgomery, U.S. generals to the British Marshal bet that can end the war before Christmas this quite seriously laid down a small ransom. Time, either American or British, everyone did not think, just before Christmas, the Allies would have been the biggest crisis since Dunkirk retreat since a.
