'cont'=>'December 16, 1947 (Chinese New Year winter and beginning of the month five)&#39;s first transistor advent. father of <br> transistor (history. cn) William Shockley, (history cn) William Shockley In in 1947 12, 16, New Jersey, USA ink Bell Labs tired mountain, three scientists - William Shockley William Shockley, John Barton (John Bardeen) and Walter Brattain (Walter Brattain) successful experiments in Bell Manufacturing of the first transistor. Changed the history of mankind. In 1950, William Shockley developed the bipolar junction transistor (bipolar junction transistor), which is now commonly known as the transistor, the first transistor technology, and commercial makeup placed market in 1953, turned out to be a hearing aid. <br> underway in the conductor circuit with the semiconductor crystal sound signal amplification experiments. The three scientists were surprised to find that part of the micro-current through the device they invented, was able to control another part of the much larger current flow, resulting in amplification effect. This device is a landmark in the history of science and technology achievements - transistor. For this reason it is invented on Christmas Eve, and the occurrence of such a huge impact on people&#39;s lives, it is called \"dedicated to the world of Christmas gift. Therefore, (on www.TodayOnHistory.com) three scientists jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics. In In <br> 1956, when the three inventors the Nobel prize, their scientific and technological achievements are stride into the families of the hundreds of millions of people in the world, used in the TV, radio, hi-fi equipment. <br> transistor promote and bring a \"solid-state revolution, thus promoting the worldwide semiconductor electronics industry. As a major component, it is timely, generally first communication tools, applications, and generate enormous economic benefits. <br> due to the transistor completely change the structure of the electronic circuit, integrated circuits and LSI came into being, so that manufacture high precision devices such as high-speed computer like to become a reality. the experimental model <br> of&#39;s first <br> Bell Labs Transistor'
