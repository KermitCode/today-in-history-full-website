'cont'=>'November 16, 1957 (September 25), Ding, China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. the brilliant scene vacated <br> Rockets, many people are not unfamiliar. Especially in the early morning of August 4, 1992, the \"Long March II E bundled majestic launch vehicle, (lssdjt.cn) communications satellite into Australia&#39;s magnificent picture of the sky, more memorable. <br> in Beijing, the central axis of the Forbidden City is marked, located in China&#39;s largest carrier rocket base - development of China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. From the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology was established on November 16, 1957 to 1992, has 35 years of history in the development of the Chinese rocket conveyance Austar \",\" Rising \"God, our carrier rockets cause. The cause of China&#39;s rocket from scratch, from weak to strong continuous development of the successful launch rocket Long March II bundled \"Austar\" as a symbol of China&#39;s space technology has advanced in the world. <br> China Carrier Rocket Technology Research Institute of the establishment of the earliest and largest development of rocket development base, lays out the trajectory of the development of China&#39;s aerospace industry, from a ten million space they developed launch vehicle and write a the Republic brilliant aerospace epic. In 1960, the Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology imitation a short-range rocket launchers, opened the curtain of China&#39;s launch vehicle. Subsequently, the Institute has been developed and successfully short-range to long-range rocket. May 1980, the Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology developed the long-range rocket to the South Pacific was successfully launched, marking China&#39;s large-scale liquid rocket technology has reached the international level. Carrier Rocket Technology Research Institute of the Long March series of rockets, has more than 20 times to various uses artificial earth satellite into space. In April 1970, the Long March 1 rocket of the first artificial satellite \"Dongfanghong into low Earth orbit, this achievement China has become the world&#39;s fifth capable of independent development and launch of the satellite countries . In November 1975, the Long March II rocket successfully launched of a remote-sensing satellite, China has become the world&#39;s first countries to have mastered the technology of satellite recovery. April 1984, the Long March rocket successfully launched China&#39;s first experimental communications satellite, China has become the world&#39;s first three use cryogenic fuel engines and a second master engine altitude ignition technology. Since then, the country with the launch of geostationary satellites, rocket technology has reached world advanced level. In July 1990, a new generation of high-thrust rocket Long March II bundled rocket was successfully launched, marking China&#39;s rocket technology has leapt to a new level and become one of the world&#39;s few master bundled technology. <br> Now, the Long March rocket series has been a big step into the international market. In 1987 and 1988, the Long March II rocket has so for France and Germany to provide satellite piggyback service. The Long March rocket in 1990 \"Asia One\" satellite into space, so our launch vehicles officially entered the international launch market. 1992 Long March II bundled rocket launchers success \"Austar\" and \"Rising\", to further enhance the ability to participate in international competition, China&#39;s aerospace technology. will also developed a new type of rocket <br> China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, China&#39;s launch vehicle to achieve serialization, universal, commercial, and to meet the requirements of various domestic and international launch services. <br>'
