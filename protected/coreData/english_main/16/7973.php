'cont'=>'In (Ding July 21), August 16, 1957, American physical chemist Langmuir&#39;s death. <br> <br> Langmuir Irving the Langmuir (1881 to 1957, August 16) <br> American chemist. January 31, 1881, was born in Brooklyn, New York, August 16, 1957 and died in Massachusetts Faermosi. (History com) graduated in 1903 from Columbia University School of Mines, was the title of Metallurgical Engineers. PhD in chemistry at the University of Gottingen, Germany was in 1906. Taught at Stephens Institute of Technology from 1906 to 1909. General Electric Research Laboratory in New York in 1909 to study physical chemistry, he served as Assistant Director in 1932 as deputy director. Langmuir in 1912 successfully developed high-vacuum tube, the tubes entered the practical stage. Developed in 1913 as nitrogen, argon incandescent. From 1924 to 1927 invention of the hydrogen atoms torch. He also developed a high vacuum mercury pump and probe submarine acoustic devices. He launched in the electronic space charge phenomena, gas discharge, atomic structure and surface chemistry of scientific research has also made great contribution. Due to the results achieved in the atomic structure and surface chemistry, the 1932 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twice in 1915 and 1920 were the Nichols Medal of the American Chemical Society, the Hughes Medal of the Royal Society and Longford Medal in 1918, the 1944 Faraday Medal. 1940 Langmuir make an important contribution to the cloud and precipitation microphysics and artificial rainfall experiment. In 1944, he published \"rising saturated cooling air flow in cooled droplets\" the first time in 1946, and his aides to explore the possibility of cloud seeding with silver iodide and solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) precipitation. 1948 \"warm cumulus chain reaction caused by rainfall,\" made a quantitative calculation of the capture efficiency drops by Xiaoyun and collision growth rate of the big cloud droplets fall in the gravitational field proposed cloud droplets broken - Growth new insights into a chain reaction when the minimum radius and the minimum height which secondary crushing, called Langmuir chain reaction. Published in the period 1948 to 1951, the \"dry ice in stratiform clouds in the seeding effect,\" a variety of control cumulus precipitation cloud seeding technology \",\" cirrus plan artificial clouds progress \"text . the <br> electron emission, space charge phenomena, gas discharge, atomic structure, surface chemistry, micro-physics of clouds and precipitation, artificial rainfall experiment have made a great contribution. <br>'
