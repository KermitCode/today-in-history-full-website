'cont'=>'(On March 12 Dingmao), April 16, 1867, American aircraft designer Wilbur Wright was born. <br> Wilbur Wright (1867 -1912 on May 12, 2011) <br> Orville Wright (August 19, 1871 January 30, -1948 day) <br> Wilbur was born in Millville, Indiana, in 1867 Orville was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871. The two brothers have received secondary education but did not receive a diploma. (Lsjt.org) <br> Wright brothers grew up in Dayton and in 1892 opened a bicycle repair, design and manufacturing company, in order to finance the growing interest in them for the flight. The basis of the results of previous studies, in 1899, they began their mechanical aeronautical test. And others, the Wright brothers more focused on strengthening the aircraft control technology, rather than bare pursuit of power upgrade, to achieve the purpose of the aircraft took off. They have developed a three-axis control, and some still use the control principle. <br> Wright brothers&#39; early research is built on the basis of Aeronautics literature, among them Lilienthal table. They soon found Smeaton coefficient (a lift and drag-and-drop formula variable) is wrong. Help their employee Charlie Taylor built wind tunnel, they tested more than two hundred different shape of the wing, and eventually worked out their table on the relationship between the shape of the wing and the air pressure. Experience and achievements, they made the bike gear, bike engine (hold) Cycling balance is critical to the success of their future in manufacturing machinery aircraft. <br> worth noting is always a work in the research project, the brothers, and the contribution they make is indivisible. the <br> aviation hundred years, then aerospace Pictured aviation ancestor the Wright brothers <br> aviation hundred years, then aerospace Pictured Wright brothers 100 the year before flying flight. <br> <br>'
