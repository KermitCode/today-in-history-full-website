The occasion of the 1000 to the birth of Jesus, the power and influence of the Papal States, getting into the peak period, Gregory VII conducted a series of efforts to enhance the Pope status, and was forced Kaiser Henry IV kneeling in the snow for three days and three nights; the Wu Erbang II with his glib tongue provoked the first time of the Crusades, became the core of the spirit of the whole of Western Europe in this crazy age. But all these into the pinnacle, it is known as \"Wan Wong Wong\" Innocent III. <br> Innocent III, formerly known as Husseini ¡¤ Lothair was born in Germany descent Roman aristocratic family, had studied theology and canon law, wrote a book, \"On the poor condition of the people\", Later, relying on his uncle - Pope Clement III relationship to become a senior officer of the Holy See. 38 years of age was finally elected to the supreme leader of the Roman spirit world.

He was included in the list due to the vigorous and resolute action so he paid. <br> Innocent III, first introduced in the Papal States centralization, his use of the subtle relationship between the aristocratic princes of the city of Rome and the pope domestic, as well as from the threat of Germany, so that they obey the authority. He adjusted to expand the papal palace institutions around the world to send Cardinal (Prior to this, has been overseen by the Archbishop of individual the Papal envoys oversight functions) to oversee the local churches. Around the bishop must be supervised its parishes and seminaries, incompetent dismissed at any time, Western Europe, the church formed a strict system under the control of the Pope. In 1199, Innocent III for the first time to church taxation of Western Europe as a whole, this system was fixed down, the pressure on the heads of the people \"tithe\". Pope&#39;s wallets, speak and act more clout. <br> Innocent III, the largest contribution to the Christian is that the 1215 Fourth Lateran Synod. This is one of the most important religious meeting Following the Constantine era since the Council of Nicaea, a devout Christian should comply with the specifications made many explanations, one of the most important provisions of the seven Christian sacraments, including baptism, adult confirmation ceremony, wedding, Mass, confession, clergy and Syria any ceremony and dying painted holy oils ceremony. Each followers at least a year should be priests repentance once to Mass once. <br> like his predecessors, Innocent III also actively involved in the the Deutsche affairs, not the army as a the hands of politicians, in addition to his weapons expelled from the membership of the adversary, the more important is the use of diplomacy to win over the party against the other party beneficiary of yourself. big debut, Innocent III, <br> bit when, are catching up with the Deutsche Hohenstaufen family, and the the Welf family of fierce competition for the throne of the Hohenstaufen family owned territory in southern Italy, For prevent Southern Italy with Germany unified under the same monarch purposes, Innocent III supports the Welf family. The real big winner in this war as long as 12 years, is the behind-the-scenes&#39; Pope, he used both promised to win Spoleto, Ancona, Papal States North Dagpo River, south to Naples border, can be described as very popular. <br> But when the Welf family Innocent supported Otto IV ascend the throne, the new emperor immediately turn, does not recognize the Pope to obtain the benefits of the war, and even ready to resort to arms. Innocent carried out of the Hohenstaufen family of orphans, he has been received as a godson, Frederick (later known as Emperor Frederick II), and allowed to form an alliance with the French king Philip II The annihilated the perfidious Otto IV finally Buwen Battle. [TodayinHistory.cn] Frederick II promised to give up the throne of Sicily and the Crusades to the Pope ascended the throne, under the support of the Innocent. <br> At the same time, the king of England, John (to the king) thing blatantly defy the Pope, the intense conflict in the power of appointment of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Thus, in 1207, the Pope will not be to the king expelled from the membership, also England excluded from the Christian area for up to six years. Innocent is also preparing support His Holiness Philip II to attack England, landless king finally forced to yield, to accept the Pope Archbishop candidates tribute to the Pope to concede defeat. <br> Innocent III laid the political landscape in Western Europe has long been submerged by the waves of history, he pioneered the policy of pagan persecution and thus the formation of traditional long history exert influence. In the mercy of God, under the banner of Innocent III dry all unkind acts. The most typical of the south of France, he \"Clean School\" (also called Arbil faction) persecution. Clean faction is to believe in good and evil dualism the Christian ascetic camp when they were characterized as heresy, was drowned. Pope Organization of Jihad Legion tackled clean camp Beziers Jerusalem, then launched a massacre, and 20,000 people were killed. In Mineierwa, more than 100 clean faction leaders were burned at the stake on stage. <br> in Innocent III shortly after his death, his nephew, and his successor, Pope Gregory IX founded the Inquisition, and claimed persecution of infidels is one of the duties of the Holy See.

View of many, or good or evil legacy he left to the Christian, he should certainly be in the rankings to occupy a seat. <br> Review: Innocent III can play a huge influence in the history, in addition to strengthen the powers of the RBC through the church reform, his main weapon is incitement to religious fervor, \"excommunicated\" the right , as well as the conflict between the monarchs to cleverly play a role, can get the biggest Yuli. In fact, in the case of medieval European political order numerous disorder, a strength can play Pope checks and balances exist or rationality. <br>'
