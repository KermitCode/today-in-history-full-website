'cont'=>'October 11, 1954 (Sino-Japanese, September 15), the death of an American physicist Theodore Lyman. <br> <br> Theodore Lyman (Theodore Lyman, 1874 - 1954 10 11, 2011), American physicist and spectroscopist hydrogen atom spectrum Lyman Department discoverer. Lyman <br> born in 1874 in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, studying physics at Harvard University in 1893, stayed on to teach after graduation in 1897. 1919 went to the University of Cambridge&#39;s Cavendish Laboratory work for two years, returned to Harvard University in 1921, holding professorships. 1926, Ryman served as director of the Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and is a Fellow of the American Academy. In Boston in 1954, died at the age of 80. <br> Lyman research career dedicated to the study of far-ultraviolet spectrum, and has developed into the vacuum spectrograph capable of measuring wavelengths shorter than 200nm spectral. 1906 Lyman and Millikan cooperation Lyman line is found in the far ultraviolet spectra of hydrogen atoms, and improve the study of the spectrum of the hydrogen atoms, confirms the Rydberg formula, Bohr model and Leeds the spectral term portfolio principle correctness. Thereafter, Ryman observed spectrum of neon, helium, aluminum, magnesium, and other elements of the shortwave solar spectrum components, but does not give satisfactory results. Later, after his death in 1959, the rocket carrying the instrument observed Lyman alpha line in the solar spectrum. In addition, the Ryman also studied the role of ultraviolet sterilization. <br> Comments: great physicist, messenger of the development of human science. <br>'
