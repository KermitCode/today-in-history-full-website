'cont'=>'The first two days (July GY), August 11, 2010, in South Asia the discovery of new superbugs. <br> August 11, 2010, researchers in the United Kingdom and India on Wednesday released its report said, (Lssdjt.com) went to India for surgery and other treatment of patients infected with a new type of super bacteria. This almost all antibiotics-resistant bacteria is transmitted to Britain from South Asia, may be spread all over the world. <br> this is called NDM-1 super bacteria originally confirmed last year by Cardiff University&#39;s Timothy - Walsh. He found two types of bacteria in a Swedish patient find NDM-1. The patients had hospital treatment in India. The researchers said this super bacteria across different types of bacteria, many infected patients in the hospital more resistant. NDM-1 bacteria and even resistant to carbapenem antibiotic carbapenem antibiotic is usually considered to be the last method of emergency treatment of drug-resistant disease. (History. Cn) <br>, South Asia and the United Kingdom, there have been several cases of infections. The universality of the researchers is to identify those patients infected with NDM-1 bacteria. <br> most of NDM-1 super bacteria Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. That the bacteria resistant to all other antibiotics except tigecycline and colistin. In some patients, even these two antibiotics do not work. <br> most critical NDM-1 super bacteria based on the structure of DNA, called a plasmid. The researchers said, it can be freely copied in bacteria and mobile, so that this bacterium has amazing potential to spread and mutation. The researchers said: \"air travel and moved to make this super bacteria spread rapidly between different countries and continents. Most countries already exists bacteria has not yet been found. \"In October 2010, the mainland China infection superbug cases, including two seven-month-old baby in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the other named Fujian lung cancer eighty-three elderly The two newborn cured, but the 85-year-old old man has died. <br> Reviews: As the research and development of new antibiotics is relatively slow, against super bacteria has become a problem faced by modern medicine. <br>'
