'cont'=>'May 19 (Gengwu years), June 11, 1990, Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech on the Taiwan issue. <br> Jiang Zemin in his speech. <br> 1990, the CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin his speech at the opening ceremony of the National United Front Work Conference on the settlement of the Taiwan issue delivered an important speech, he reiterated: as long as the two sides to sit down and, true to the spirit of \"one China \"principle to negotiate the reunification of the motherland, instead of engaging in the\" two-China \",\" one China, one Taiwan \",\" one country, two governments \", all problems can be brought up for discussion, and discuss. <br> Jiang Zemin said, recently, Mr. Lee Teng-hui comes to the issue of cross-strait relations, \"Taiwan and the mainland is an inalienable part of Chinese territory\", \"all Chinese compatriots of the same flesh and blood\", \"China the unity and prosperity is the common aspiration of all Chinese people, and also offered to establish communication channels, \"discuss national unity matters. We appreciate that. But there are some things obviously very inappropriate, lack of sincerity, but this is more than \"no contact, no negotiations, no compromise\" is better. <br> Jiang Zemin pointed out, we all know, to achieve the reunification of the motherland through peace talks over the years of our party has always stood for. As early as the 1950s, our party leader Mao Zedong, (lsjt.org) Comrade Zhou Enlai proposed \"and is precious\", \"patriotic a hope that the Taiwan authorities,\" they think the appropriate time, sending representatives to Beijing or other appropriate location, with us on the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue to discuss. The early 1980s, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the concept of \"one country, two systems\" approach to achieve the reunification of the motherland. In one country, the implementation of the different political, economic and social systems, and I do not eat you, you do not eat me, mutual respect and common prosperity. This is to take care of the interests of all parties, the best way to achieve the reunification of China from reality. This idea is put forward to resolve the Taiwan issue, the first has been successfully applied in the settlement of the Hong Kong and Macao. (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> Jiang Zemin pointed out that, in accordance with international law, a country can only have a legitimate government on behalf of this country. A nation can not exist two representatives of the government of this country. The so-called \"one country, two governments\", the essence of \"two Chinas\", \"one China, one Taiwan\" is toward the division, not unification. We stand by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Kuomintang bipartisan talks <br> Jiang Zemin. This is a departure from the reality of the situation of the two parties and the current status of the role, but also in order to avoid Taiwan feel inconvenient. At the same time, we also always attaches importance to the role of the two sides of the other parties, groups and people from all walks of life to achieve the reunification of the motherland. Bipartisan talks with various parties, organizations demonstrate their motion to discuss state; discussing informed in a timely manner, to exchange views; can absorb even participating in the talks on behalf of the other parties, groups representative people. <br> Jiang Zemin pointed out that the cross-strait \"three links\" before formal negotiations as soon as possible, to expand the two-way exchange. About some of the specific issues in cross-strait exchanges, respectively, through the appropriate channels negotiated settlement. <br> Jiang Zemin pointed out that, in 40 years, the achievements of socialist construction of New China, the universally recognized. No force in the world can stop us move forward on the construction of the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He stressed that to achieve the reunification of the motherland is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people in cross-strait also all over the world love the motherland and the common aspiration of the Chinese people. Cooperation benefits both, away from the two injuries; bury the hatchet, hand in hand. We hope that Mr. Lee Teng-hui from the reality, as the most important interests of the state and the nation, the wishes of the people, to assume the historical responsibility to contribute to the reunification of the motherland and the rejuvenation of the nation. <br>'
