'cont'=>'(JiMao July day), August 11, 1999, the last total solar eclipse of the 20th century. <br> 1999 August 11, 2011, Europe and in some parts of the watch to a magnificent spectacle of a total solar eclipse. <br> The total solar eclipse of this century, the last total solar eclipse will last about two minutes, it will start from the Atlantic Ocean. Passing shadow of the moon the southwest corner of the United Kingdom, the English Channel from Normandy in northern France, boarded the European continent, and then swept across Europe in Germany [on cn] Austria, [history cn] Hungary [History on cn] Romania and Bulgaria Asian countries; into Asia via the Black Sea, (lssdjt.cn) across Turkey, [history cn] Iraq [history cn] Iran [history today. cn] Pakistan and India, and finally disappeared in the Indian Ocean. This food with more than 10 thousand kilometers long, but the width is only about 100 kilometers. In food with, from morning to afternoon, followed by a total solar eclipse. The total solar eclipse of longest duration locations, the department&#39;s total solar eclipse in over one hundred kilometers northwest of Bucharest, the Romanian capital, near the city of Rimnicu Vilcea width of 112 km, at the centerline of fresh extension of time 2 minutes 23 seconds. <br> nearly 150 years, the total solar eclipse seen in Europe is less than 10 times, especially in Central Europe, the last time was in 1842 to see; at least 30 years, Europe can no longer see the new The total solar eclipse. In Hungary, even have to wait until the year 2135 to see a total solar eclipse. Therefore, the total solar eclipse aroused great enthusiasm for the European public. the <br> astronomers keen interest in the total solar eclipse, because of the time there will be a special phenomenon many usually difficult, even impossible. This is the atmosphere of the sun itself, the outer layer of the solar corona and chromosphere sun detection of particularly favorable opportunity. In fact, in the 1980s, our knowledge of the solar atmosphere, most of the knowledge of the physical state of the solar atmosphere are from the observation of a total solar eclipse. The total solar eclipse on the Earth&#39;s environment such as temperature, magnetic field, ionosphere, radio communications and other certain impact, therefore, provides a special opportunity to study the Sun-Earth effect or the relationship between the Earth. Nearly 150 years, each time where the total solar eclipse, scientists always have to use various means, and even developed a special observation equipment, all sorts of scientific exploration and research. <br> The total solar eclipse, but also coincided with changes in solar activity is very intense during the peak years (the sun&#39;s activity has a 11-year periodic law, currently at near peak period), therefore, the total solar eclipse for scientific exploration, but also of great significance. <br> total solar eclipse is a normal astronomical phenomenon. Today, astronomers not only already know the causes of the total solar eclipse, but also according to the laws of science to accurately calculate and forecast the total solar eclipse occurs every moment, be quite true! <br>'
