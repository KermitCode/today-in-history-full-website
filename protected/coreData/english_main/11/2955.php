'cont'=>'March 11, 1955 (February 18), Yi Wei, the death of British Alexander Fleming. The invention <br> penicillin (1928) <br> since ancient times, the infectious disease is the enemy of mankind. Generation after generation of scientists have made unremitting efforts in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Later research found that the bacteria is the culprit of infectious diseases, so people are doing everything possible to find new drugs to kill infectious bacteria. Until penicillin was discovered, infectious diseases almost untreatable era gone forever, the average human life span has been extended. <br> the discovery of penicillin is a British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming. 1928, Fleming found in checking the petri dish in a petri dish aureus contaminated long a large group of mildew and the the mycophenolate group around the staphylococcus was killed, only far away from the mycophenolate group place have aureus growth. He mycophenolate group inoculated into sterile agar medium and broth, the results found in the broth, mold growth soon, the formation of a white in a green and dark green mildew group. Through the identification, Fleming know a This mold is Penicillium Thus, after filtering the resulting containing this mold liquid secretions called \"penicillin\". Subsequently Flemming again this petri dish mold was inoculated into a variety of bacteria, staphylococcus, streptococcus, and diphtheria and so can be suppressed. This greatly encouraged are eager to find a treatment of septic infection drugs Fleming. After a series of tests and studies, Fleming penicillin may become a way to systemic antimicrobial drugs. <br> 1929, Fleming published report of his findings. Penicillin purification problems have not been resolved, and the difficulties encountered in the mass production of this drug. In <br> 1935, the British pathologist Florey and biochemist residing in the United Kingdom, Germany, money grace to re-examine the nature of penicillin, separation and chemical structure finally solved the problem of penicillin enrichment. Positive during the Second World War, the development and production of penicillin transferred to the United States. Mass production of penicillin, and save millions of sick and wounded, and one of the three great inventions of World War II and the atomic bomb, radar alongside. <br> contribution to the benefit of mankind Fleming, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. The discovery of penicillin is a milestone in the history of human development, antibiotic. Until today, it is still the most widely popular, the most widely used antibiotics. Penicillin can kill a variety of bacteria, can also be the treatment of various inflammatory. And its body is almost no toxicity. Therefore, in addition to the handful of people who are allergic to penicillin, the majority of patients with the penicillin restore health. <br> is the discovery of penicillin led to the climax of the medical profession looking for antibiotic new drug, mankind has entered the era of the synthesis of new drugs. <br> 1955 Fleming, 11, passed away. <br> antibiotics (1928) <br>'
