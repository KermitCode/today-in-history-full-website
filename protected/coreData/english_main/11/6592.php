'cont'=>'July 11, 1993 (May 22) πÔ”œ British bred the world&#39;s first transgenic rooster. On 11, <br> 1993 Edinburgh scientists is the world&#39;s first transgenic cock bred through genetic engineering techniques. The research results, create the conditions for the cultivation hens so that gave birth to the egg contains extremely valuable pharmaceutical ingredients. <br> this Code for LY8-1 transgenic rooster British Agricultural and Food Research Council, Roslin Animal Physiology and Genetic Institute scientists cultivated. Using gene recombination technology to the exogenous genes to the cock body, and so that only the cock with carrying the same exogenous gene of a few transgenic hens for mating. So they get 128 eggs, LY8-1 chicken is an egg hatch. <br> they let transgenic rooster mate with many hens can get genetically modified chicken, these chicks grow up to mate with each other after the last will be able to get a purebred transgenic hens. British scientists believe this recombinant technology also applies to some human genes into chicken body responsible for the manufacture of extremely valuable pharmaceutical ingredients, the egg containing these ingredients, such as clotting factor for hemophiliacs dredge The tissue plasminogen arteries. <br>'
