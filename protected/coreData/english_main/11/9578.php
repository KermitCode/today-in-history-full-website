'cont'=>'(, Seeing in leap August 17), October 11, 1995, President Jiang met with a delegation of the major U.S. news media. <br> 1995 10 11, the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with a high-level delegation of the American \"Newsweek\" and \"U.S. News and World Report\" magazine editor-in-chief Mortimer Zuckerman and his party . Meeting, the issue of Sino-US relations, the Taiwan issue, China&#39;s development prospects, President Jiang issued a conversation and answer guests&#39; questions. (History com) <br> about Sino-US relations, Jiang said: Sino-US relations are facing difficulties, the U.S. allowing Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States single-handedly created. Prior to this incident, we again and again to the United States expressly stand firmly opposed to Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States. U.S. April 17 is also said to us, Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States, even if it is a private visit, is also a violation of the \"one China\" policy held by the U.S. government. Shortly after, the White House suddenly announced, Lee Teng-hui on a private visit in the United States is also in line with the policy of the U.S. government. This point can not understand most Chinese people. 1.2 billion people of China on the Taiwan issue is very sensitive, and can only think, after listening to the confusion saying U.S. authorities on this issue, is the performance of a hegemony, it can be said is Conspire, hands on the rain. 100 years is a popular powers bullying. Including people of my age, eight years of resistance to the modern history of China, is clearly the kind of tyranny and the times we remember. After the founding of New China, the kind of slaughter of the era gone forever. Therefore, to overcome the difficulties in the relations of the two countries, of course, requires the United States to take measures to eliminate the serious consequences caused by Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States. We note that the United States has repeatedly said, will abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques, adhere to the \"one China\" policy, and to handle relations with Taiwan in this range, against the \"two-China\", \" one Taiwan \"in the proposition and opposition to Taiwan independence, and opposition to Taiwan joining the United Nations. We give this positive evaluation. We also note that the United States, said Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States recognized the sensitivity and seriousness of such incidents in the future will be strictly limited. We think that the U.S. side the stand is not enough. The key is to abide by the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the U.S. action, and earnestly fulfill the solemn commitment made to win the trust of the Chinese people, the Sino-US relations gradually return to a healthy and stable track. <br> On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said that the Taiwan issue is China&#39;s internal affair. How to achieve reunification, on January 30 this year, I published eight points of views. (Lssdjt.cn) still stands for the principle of \"peaceful reunification and one country, two systems\". We are opposed to is the \"two Chinas\", \"one China, one Taiwan\" and Taiwan independence. We do not undertake to renounce the use of force. We made up this determination, the event aimed at splitting the motherland situation, whether it is international hostile forces from the outside, or Taiwan separatist forces, we may use non-peaceful means inevitable. Of course, we definitely do not want this day. I have spoken in the eight o&#39;clock opinions, the Chinese do not fight Chinese people, we welcome the visit of the leader of the Taiwan authorities in an appropriate identity; We are also willing to accept the invitation of the Taiwan side to visit Taiwan. Chinese people the things we do, and do not need to take an international occasion. Any question can be discussed, \"two Chinas\", \"one China, one Taiwan\" Taiwan independence can not talk about. The question now is, Lee Teng-hui&#39;s visit to the United States in June 1995, and advocated \"two China\" in the international arena, \"one China, one Taiwan,\" Taiwan&#39;s independence and undermine the basis of cross-strait relations. In short, only under the \"one China\" principle, the meeting of the leaders on both sides is meaningful. <br> China&#39;s development prospects, President Jiang said: Not long ago, we just opened the Fifth Plenary Session of the 14th Party Congress, through the national economic and social development of the \"Ninth Five-Year Plan and Vision 2010 The goal of the proposal, drawn the grand blueprint to achieve national prosperity and national rejuvenation of the next century. Our party more united, stronger, more mature leadership on economic and social development. We are confident that we have the ability to put a sustained economic development and overall social progress, full of life and hope into the 21st century. <br> After 10 years, 15 years of efforts, China&#39;s social productive forces will have a big development, will greatly enhance the comprehensive national strength. A prosperous and strong and prosperous China is an important force in safeguarding world peace and promoting the development of the cause of human progress, and will play a more active role in the establishment of a peaceful, stable, just and reasonable new international order. Our country 100 years of invasion, oppression ordeal, China in the future even if the strong, nor pose a threat to other countries to aggression, oppression in other countries. In any case, we will never seek hegemony. <br>'
