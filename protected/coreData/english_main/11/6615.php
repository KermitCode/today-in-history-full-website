'cont'=>'(Dingmao June 16), July 11, 1987, the day of the world&#39;s 50 million population. <br> <br> 1987 July 11, 2011, 5 billion of the world&#39;s first residents born in the former Yugoslavia, Zagreb. His name called Matthaei Gaspar. Later, the city of Zagreb was fixed for the first five billion residents of the city. At that time the world&#39;s major newspaper front page published \"The global population to break into the 5 billion mark\", \"5000000000 means\" very striking and thought-provoking title. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) announced this day as 5,000,000,000 Population Day, July 11 as the World Population Day. <br> was born from the human to the early 19th century, after millions of years of the long years of the world&#39;s total population to reach 1 billion. After the beginning of the 20th century, the growth rate of the world population is growing fast. By 1930, the world population reached 20 million, more than doubled in the early 19th century. By 1960, world population growth to 30 million and 15 years to 4 billion in 1975, just 12 years from 4000000000-5000000000. According to demographers projected to the end of the century, the world population is expected to reach 6.3 billion. The world&#39;s population is per 3 people, 25 people daily in rapid growth. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) called on the countries should seriously consider and discuss the population problem, because this sustained high growth of the population has had a profound impact on the world economy and even world politics. performance <br> this effect: <br> the North-South gap between rich and poor is further expanded. The early postwar period, the gap between developed and developing countries in terms of per capita national income is 10:1, despite 30 years after the war, the developing countries, industrial production and national income growth is slightly higher than in developed countries, but developing countries as a result of population growth too fast, the end of the 1970s, this gap but expanded to 13:1. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> second is to continue to impede the economic development of developing countries. Developing countries due to the excessive population growth, consumption fund share of national income, domestic investment rates have declined, resulting in economic development is restricted. At the same time, the contradiction between population and food is more prominent. <br> the deterioration of the natural environment growing, mainly in the forest area is drastically reduced, desertification is a serious shortage of safe drinking water. Developing countries due to population growth, in order to survive, had to deforestation, land reclamation, causing serious soil erosion due to deforestation farmland, deserts expand in arid regions. <br> rapid population growth in developing countries not only affect their own economic development, but also affect the development of the world economy, but also affect the peace and stability in the world. In 1974, the United Nations World Population Conference held in Bucharest, prompting countries to give greater attention to the development of the world&#39;s population. 10 years later, the country to control population growth in the world 85, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and most populous country has carried out for the purpose of contraception, population control policy. <br> 50 billion population day \"again a wake-up call to the world. <br>'
