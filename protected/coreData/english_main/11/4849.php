'cont'=>'May 11, 1995 (April 12), seeing in the dawn of 1000 massively parallel computer system through national Kam. In In 1995, May 11, 2010, \"Dawning 1000\" massively parallel computer system through a national identification. Following the Galaxy I, with the dawn of the 1st, the development of high-performance computers in China is another new milestone. <br> \"Dawning 1000\" massively parallel computer system peak speed of 2.5 billion times per second, the actual computing speed of 1.58 billion times per second, 15,000 unknowns linear equations can solve, than on the scale of the problem solving similar foreign machines. The system exceeded some of the key technology for massively parallel processing the interconnect chip has originality, parallel optimizing compiler is one of the best systems in the world. The system has a wide range of prospects for computers and workstations is difficult to solve many of the problems can be resolved. As greatly enhancing the exploration of oil and natural gas forecasting capability for simulation to design new aircraft, new materials, new drugs, new catalyst can also be an urgent need to meet the basic research work on a massively parallel machine. The research project was the 1997 National Science and Technology Progress Award. <br> \"Dawning\" large-scale parallel computer <br>'
