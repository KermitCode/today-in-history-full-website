'cont'=>'April 11, 1983 (February 28) Guihai, Wuxi over the lowered giant ice. <br> 1983 12:00 Wuxi East Gate over sudden drop a large ice diameter of about five, sixty centimeters. After landing a loud noise, and the ice then scattered into many small pieces, the largest diameter of about 10 cm. Ice after landing on the ground to form a layer of mist around telephone poles had been an earthquake shaking up. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> At that time, it was considered \"extraterrestrial\". Later researchers by the National Academy of Meteorological Bureau, Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Bureau, Purple Mountain Observatory, Beijing Observatory, Suzhou Meteorological Observatory, Yancheng Meteorological Observatory and Wuxi weather station, inspect the scene of huge ice fall, the ground meteorological data analysis and crossing The survey of the aircraft flown by excluded Wuxi giant ice meteorological and man-made causes. Then they found on the satellite imageries from the date of the mysteries: \"extraterrestrial\" into the atmosphere, the warming due to compressed air and friction to produce a high-temperature gas column trajectory; after Globe scaling, this trajectory the end point Wuxi. This provides a reliable basis for the meteorite ice conclusion. Wuxi City 73-year-old, <br> retired worker Wang Quandi aunt sacrificed their own cans meteorite ice fragments dissolved in water, and uncover the mystery of the giant ice provides a direct physical, chemical and biological analysis laboratory samples . The researchers believe that participated in the study, the meteorite ice findings not only confirm the universe beyond Earth there is water, and provide direct evidence for exploring the structural model of comet ice. This is the study of the formation and evolution of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and hydrosphere, the causes of the celestial bodies of the solar system and the origin of life is of great significance. <br>'
