'cont'=>'(Landmarks April fifth day), May 11, 1997, the world chess champion Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue \"contest. the <br> Kasparov with the super-computer \"Deep Blue\" chess (right field operator for the \"Deep Blue\") <br> in 1997, chess world champion Kasparov and IBM&#39;s chess computer Deep Blue the sixth inning Tournament curtain fell. In 5 Innings tie 2.5 vs 2.5 cases, Kasparov in sixth plate tiebreaker only walk 19 steps to the \"Deep Blue\" hand over to concede defeat. The whole game was less than an hour. \"Deep Blue\" won this confrontation has a special significance. <br> this result in the end of the second inning began to take shape. \"Deep Blue\" the victory that Bureau perfect Kasparov self-confidence is a serious blow. After the game, his assistant saw him sitting in the corner of the room, his hands cover their face. Three of the third, fourth, fifth inning and the Board has caused the collapse of Kasparov&#39;s morale, caused the collapse of his physical strength. According to reports, Kasparov said after the game, the last game, \"I have been unable to fight another day. The \"<br> never so troubled by Kasparov. Since 1985 to become world champion in 12 years, and his position in the field of chess has not been faced with severe challenges in the latest rating points standings, he ranked first rating points over 2800 points, no one has ever reached This height. He is considered one of the strongest chess player ever. <br> 5 Innings, he has been taken to a specially designed strategy to deal with the \"Deep Blue\", \"Deep Blue\" in order to avoid the powerful computing power directly to wrestle, he chose a weird start, try to avoid pawn contact dismount so all the experts by surprise. However, this did not achieve remarkable results. Regardless of the opponent to use what tactics, \"Deep Blue\" always quietly, quickly out of the strongest should hand. In the last game, Kasparov apparently lost patience, the first time he has taken the \"normal\" dismount. The initial steps chess Let watch the chess fans have rejoiced, thinking that powerful Kasparov restore his true colors. But soon joy became frustrated. The seventh round, Kasparov committed an irreparable low-level errors, the situation worsened, and soon Kasparov had no hope. Struggling after a few steps, he gave up resistance hastily signed Chengxiazhimeng. <br> \"Deep Blue\" to create a new record. In 1988, its previous generation \"food for thought\" is the first to win a chess grandmaster computer; 1996, \"Deep Blue\" became the first to win the world champion of chess computers; also become the first race in a multi-bureau computer to defeat the world chess champion. Kasparov once said computer to beat a world champion, have to wait until 2010, \"Deep Blue\" this day in advance for 13 years. <br> \"Deep Blue\" weighing about 1.4 tons, 32 nodes, each node has eight processor designed specifically for chess chess average computing speed of 2,000,000 steps per second. A total of 256 processors integrated in the IBM developed RS6000/SP parallel computing system, which has over 200 million steps per second at an alarming rate. It does not tired and does not psychologically undulation, nor interference by the opponent. Its defect is not intuitive, not real thinking. But during the race, \"Deep Blue\" infinite computing power largely compensate for these defects, which in turn make people think (? V history today?? Com) What is the nature of thinking? Mysterious thinking it? \"Deep Blue and Kasparov confrontation some enlightenment on this issue to what extent? <br> IBM development team to input 100 years, all, international grandmaster start and mess dismount, \"Deep Blue\" in six innings Tournament since 1996 after Kasparov lost 2:4 doubled the speed of operation of the \"Deep Blue\", American grandmaster Benjamin joined the \"Deep Blue\" team, his understanding of chess compiled program to teach the \"Deep Blue\". After the end of the game, \"Deep Blue\" team published a secret, each end of the game, the team will modify specific parameters corresponding Kasparov, Deep Blue is not thinking, but these actually played a \"role\" to force it to learn, Kasparov never been able to find an effective way to deal with the \"Deep Blue\" the main reason. Today&#39;s \"Deep Blue\" is not the 1996&#39;s \"Deep Blue.\" <br> \"Deep Blue\" The victory marks computer technology on a new level, we will henceforth have to think seriously about the relationship between people and computers. It is said that after losing the second game, Kasparov had sleepless nights. At this point, not only Kasparov, we should learn to accept the reality of computer in some respects have been enough to contest. <br>'
