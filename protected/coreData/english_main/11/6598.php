(l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> Tang Youqi years of teaching and research work in physical chemistry and structural chemistry. America during Under the guidance of the famous chemist LC Pauling, the main crystal structure analysis and chemical bonding theory, study the nature of the formation of the alloy super structure and hexamethylene tetramine and metal ion complexation. opened after returning to the crystal chemistry courses, preparation the structure of the chemical laboratory, and conduct a study of the crystal structure and structural chemistry. combination of the domestic needs of the development of the petrochemical industry in 1970, to decide the key issue of the performance of several catalysts, the active ingredient in the carrier and to explore surface distribution pattern in 1979, presided over the construction of a four-circle diffractometer supporting computer-based single-crystal structure laboratory and biomolecular structural chemistry and surface structure chemistry, to carry out the research, made a lot of results He presided over the material and structure laboratory is one of the main units to participate in the insulin structure determination. published papers on the one hundred, with crystal chemistry (1957), \"Statistical mechanics and its application in physical chemistry\" ( 1964), the \"principle of chemical kinetics and reactor (1974), the symmetrical image of group theory principle\" (1977), phase equilibria, chemical equilibrium and thermodynamics \"(1984). <br> ; Comments: respected chemist fruitful. <br>'
