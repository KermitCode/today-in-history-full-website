Joan Crawford (Lssdjt.com) <br> formerly known as Lucille Lai Suer, from Texas, she started out by dancing into the Broadway Chorus, and then signed with MGM contract. However, the producers did not want to use her real name, so the producers have appealed to the public: choose a stage name for the wide shoulders, curved eyebrows, dark-eyed girl. People should call her Joan - Crawford. She is not a special performance ability, also not versatile (though in the film \"Mildred - Pierce\" plays a tearjerker, sacrifice their role as mothers won an Oscar). Crawford married Fairbanks is also a movie star, a couple of them, and comedian Charlie Chaplin is a charismatic movie star of the silent era.
