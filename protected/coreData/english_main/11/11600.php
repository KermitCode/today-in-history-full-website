'class'=>4,
'cont'=>'December 11, 1863 (Guihai years of winter and beginning of the month), American female astronomer, one of the pioneers of stellar spectra Anne Cannon was born. <br> Anne Cannon (Annie Jump Cannon, 1863 12, 11, 2011 -1941 April 13), American female astronomer, made in the classification of stellar spectra pioneering work. <br> Anne Cannon was born in Dover, Delaware City, in 1863 and his father is a wealthy shipbuilding division. Cannon in 1880 Wellesley College in Massachusetts to learn physics, where she was infected with scarlet fever, and almost completely lost his hearing. After graduating in 1884, Cannon returned home in 1894 back to Wellesley College, served as the assistant of the Department of Physics, a master&#39;s degree at the same time. In 1895, Cannon went to Radcliffe College studying astronomy, and later became the assistant of the Harvard College Observatory Director Edward Pickering, 1896 to become the assistant of the Observatory. <br> 1900&#39;s, Cannon to the color of the star as the basis, in descending order according to the star&#39;s surface temperature, the spectral classification into the early establishment of the Edward Pickering et al divided O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, S and other types of classification method, known as the \"Harvard Classification\", is widely used in astronomy. Pickering died, Cannon presided over the work of the Harvard College Observatory stellar spectral classification, classification of a spectrum of more than 200,000 stars, compilation and publication of the Henry Draper Star Table. From 1925 to 1936, she and her colleagues continue to be classified more than ten million stars, compiled the Henry Draper extended star catalog. <br> 1925, Cannon get awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford, is the first win of the women. In 1931, Cannon Henry Draper Prize awarded by the American Academy because of the split in stellar spectra. To commemorate her, a crater on the moon named after her \"Cannon\". <br> Comments: In the case of \"almost complete loss of hearing,\" she achieved the amazing achievements of astronomy, it is worth us normal people learn to reflect on. <br>'
