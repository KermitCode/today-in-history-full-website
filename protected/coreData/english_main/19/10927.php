'title'=>'Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu was Pupin Medal',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'November 19, 1991 (, Xinwei October 14), the Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu was Pupin Medal. <br> CS Wu was born in Jiangsu Province, Taicang County in 1912, and a doctorate in the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. In 1956, she was the weak interaction of electrons and Mirror symmetry arguments are not always mutually verified by experiments. The experiment has shocked the world physics community. Now that Wu, Ph.D., is a professor of Columbia University, Department of Physics Honor, have made outstanding contributions in academic research, she has been awarded the honorary doctorate conferred by the 16 universities in the world. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> In recognition of the outstanding contribution in the field of physics of Professor Wu Jianxiong, November 19, 1991, Columbia University awarded her high honor on behalf of Polytechnic sector Pupin Medal. Consul General of the Consulate General of the Republic of China in the United States grand hosted a dinner to celebrate the great contemporary Chinese female physicist Chien-Shiung Wu won the the Pupin medal. At the reception, broke a conservative insider information for 50 years: CS Wu studying in the U.S. when the doctoral dissertation research, (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) to make the first successful trial of the first atomic bomb. <br> during World War II, U.S. scientists have discovered powerful nuclear fission energy, to be used can create a powerful powerful than ordinary bombs dozens of times the atomic bomb. President Roosevelt ordered the allocation of $ 2 billion, [lsjt.net] established code-named \"Manhattan Project atomic bomb research institutions. In 1939, two American physicists After the study, the uranium nuclear might split in half and release a lot of energy at the same time. This information will soon spread to the University of California, Berkeley, begs a lot of questions to be answered. At that time, Wu just do experiments and research work in the school with Saige Rui Professor cooperation. The Sege Rui professor recommended a review of the nuclear fission of uranium, whether there will be \"noble gases\". But by this time, (lsjt.net) Saige Rui Professor&#39;m going to New York to visit old friends Fermi professor. CS Wu will separate detection of uranium nuclear fission is a rare gas \", to identify several noble gases leads radioactive series. Her to write his doctoral thesis research. Saige Rui professor after returning to California, see Wu&#39;s experimental results very excited and immediately let her write the results of these experiments as a SMS sent to the American Physical communication, detailed lab report in accordance with the relevant U.S. secrecy agreement shall not be published. <br> in this period, as the \"Manhattan Project\" Commander professor of Fermi nuclear reactor in Washington Province Han Buddhist city. Atomic furnace continuous reaction in the first few hours after inexplicably stopped. Professor Fermi suspect may be a substance produced in the splitting of the atom, the most neutron absorption, therefore, to stop the chain reaction. Professor Fermi Saige Rui said: \"You ask Miss Wu Jianxiong! . \" Fermi find CS Wu, secrecy doctoral thesis. The original atomic furnace pause, it is located in Wu&#39;s doctoral dissertation research nucleus splits one of the \"noble gas\" poisoning a chain reaction. Knowing atoms furnace pause reason easily identify the \"antidote\", the atomic furnace and begin normal operation. A result, the first atomic bomb was finally successful trial in the United States first. <br>'
