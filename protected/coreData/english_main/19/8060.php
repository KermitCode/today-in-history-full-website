'cont'=>'August 19, 1662 (on July sixth days Renyin years), the famous French physicist, the founders of the modern theory of probability Pascal&#39;s death. the death of Blaise Pascal, <br> \"target =\" _blank \"> Pascal (1623.6.19-1662.8.19, 350 years ago), the famous French mathematician, physicist, philosopher and essayist. outstanding contributions in physics, the famous Pascal&#39;s law was first proposed in 1653, this famous essay written in a fluid balance exposition \", discusses in detail the transfer of the liquid pressure application of the law of the manufacture of a wide range of hydraulic machinery, mankind has created numerous miracles, he established the principle of intuitionism Later, some philosophers such as Rousseau and Bergson, and so influential. <br> 1623 June 19 born in Clermont-Ferrand, France Aowei Nie Province no formal schooling, his mother died when he was 4 years old, by the highly educated, as a father and two sisters of the government officials responsible for his education and culture his father is a respected mathematician, In its carefully Education, Pascal was very proficient in Euclidean geometry, he found the first 32 theorems of Euclidean and the order is completely correct. 12-year-old found alone interior angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees, began under the tutelage of his father to learn mathematics. [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] 1631 Pascal family moved to Paris. father Pascal amount to anything, he was 16 years old, full of like him to participate in the Paris mathematicians and physicists Group (the predecessor of the Paris Academy of Sciences), academic activities, let him eye-opener, (history today www.lssdjt.com) 17 at the age of Pascal written math high levels of conic section &#39;article, he studies the results of Dezhaerge classic work on integrated projective geometry. Descartes firmly do not believe the 16-year-old child be able to write out this book, Pascal in turn does not recognize the value of Descartes&#39; analytic geometry. <br> 1641, Pascal family moved to Rouen from 1642 to 1644 to help the father to do the tax calculations, Pascal invented the adder This is the world&#39;s first calculator, now on display in a French museum to 1653, his focus on research on vacuum and hydrostatic, made a series of major achievements from 1647 to 1648, he published papers on vacuum problem. his research and writings on vacuum problem, more to improve his popularity. Pascal 1648 envisaged and different the highly atmospheric pressure measured experiments on the same area and found that with the reduced height, atmospheric pressure laws. increased in the past few years, Pascal experiment continue to make new discoveries, and there are a number of major inventions, such as the invention of the syringe, the hydraulic press, improved Torricelli mercury barometer. <br> Pascal&#39;s death August 19, 1662, aged 39 years old after the Memorial human Pascal&#39;s contribution, the pressure units named after his name, referred to as Pa, the symbol is Pa <br>'
