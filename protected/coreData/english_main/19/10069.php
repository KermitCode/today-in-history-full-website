'cont'=>'(Landmarks September 16), October 19, 1937, British physicist Rutherford&#39;s death. <br> famous British physicist Rutherford was born \"target =\" _blank \"> Rutherford, is the winner of the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in nuclear physics and chemistry, he made a huge contribution. <br> However, Rutherford merit more than that. When people comment Rutherford achievement, always mentioned his \"students everywhere Rutherford&#39;s careful cultivation, he students and assistants many people get the Nobel Prize: 1921, Rutherford&#39;s assistant Soddy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Rutherford&#39;s students Aston won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922; 1922, Luther blessing the students, Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics; Rutherford&#39;s assistant, Wilson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927; Rutherford&#39;s students Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935; 1948, Rutherford assistant Blackett won the Nobel Prize in Physics; 1951, students (lsjt.org) Rutherford Cork Rafter and tile ear Dayton, shared the Nobel Prize in Physics; 1978, Rutherford students Kapi Ci won the Nobel Prize in Physics. (TodayinHistory.cn) <br> Some people say that the established world of training personnel Nobel Prize, then Rutherford No. candidates! <br> of 1871, Luther blessing born in New Zealand, a handicraft family after graduating from college in 1895, the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, he had an internship, a physicist JJ Thomson students and assistants he emigrated to Canada in 1898, any mark ranks ear professor at the University in 1907, he settled in England, he was professor at the University of Manchester in 1918, he served as director of the Cambridge University Cavendish Laboratory has made significant achievements <br> Rutherford in the study of radioactive phenomena and atomic structure. In 1899, he discovered the two components in the radioactive radiation, and named alpha ray ¦Â-ray, then they found a new radioactive elements thorium \"while working in Canada in 1902, he and British chemist cable Di one, through the study of radioactive uranium, put forward the theory of atomic natural metamorphosis: radioactive phenomenon atomic own metamorphosis in the transformation process, the atoms of one element into atoms of another element, radiating alpha particles and beta particles. theory break through the theory of atoms can not be divided, and opened a new page in the history of physics, causing a revolution in the field of physics and chemistry. contribution due to the above, Rutherford won the Nobel chemistry prize in 1908, 1911, Rutherford, according to the ¦Á-particle scattering experiment (known as the Rutherford experiment), discovered the existence of the atomic nucleus, which proposed the planetary model of atomic structure: the structure of the atom similar to the structure of the solar system, the center of the atom has a positively charged nucleus and negatively charged electrons rotate around the nucleus. equal to the sum of the electron charge within the atomic nuclear power, the entire atom neutral model hypothesis is still not perfect, but for people to explore the atomic structure of the internal open the mysterious door 1919, Rutherford bombarded nitrogen atoms with radioactive elements polonium alpha particles, oxygen isotope, first artificial transmutation of elements 1920 He also predicted the existence of the neutron that nuclei exist within certain uncharged particles, can be easily driven into the atomic nucleus, or nuclei combine, or transformation in its powerful venue after 12 years, this neutron really found the best artillery bombarded nuclei, provided the conditions for the the nucleus chain reaction, radioactive Atomic Energy. Rutherford, October 19, 1937, died aged 66 in Cambridge, UK Hospital. posterity To commemorate him, his name is named radioactive intensity units. <br>'
