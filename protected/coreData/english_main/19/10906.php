'cont'=>'The ninth day of October (1901), November 19, 1901, the Chinese physicist - Shi Ruwei Born. <br> facilities Ruwei, Chinese physicist. November 19, 1901 Born in Chongming County, Jiangsu Province (now part of Shanghai). In 1924, graduated from Nanjing Higher Normal School Department of Mechanical Engineering of Southeast University) (ie, alterations, and in 1925 graduated from the Department of Physics, Southeast University. The same year to 1930 in the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University, any assistant. 1930 to the United States to study at the University of Illinois in 1931, gold - iron alloy magnetic received a master&#39;s degree thesis \". At Yale University in 1934 iron - cobalt single crystal magnetic Ph.D. thesis \". Back in August 1934, he was a researcher at the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, research material magnetic. 1943 to 1945, he served as professor of Guangxi University, teaching electromagnetism and thermal science courses. 1945 Back to the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica remain committed to the magnetic studies. After the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Applied Physics (1958 to the Institute of Physics), initially engaged and to guide the work of the magnetic and subsequently served as Acting Director (1954 to 1956), the director (1957 ~ 1981) and honorary director (1981 to 1983). He was also elected as the Chinese Physical Society Vice Chairman and Secretary-General (1963 to 1982), employed as the Academy of Mathematics Physics Chemistry Division (later the mathematical physics Ministry) Acdemy (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½)] 1955. He made important contributions to the scientific planning, development and scientific personnel training for the development of the cause of the physics and magnetic. Died in Beijing on January 8, 1983. <br> facilities Ruwei adhere to the theory with the actual fine style of study, in the early 1930s, the first task is completed in China \"chromium chloride hexahydrate paramagnetic susceptibility\" (1931) this period on the magnetic anisotropy of the iron - cobalt (1934) and nickel - cobalt alloy single crystal (1936) is an important task in the basic metal magnetic studies. Before and after the 1940s, on the the permalloy (1939) and magnetite (1940) crystal magnetic domain Trichoplusia map, creating a work of domestic experimental observation of magnetic domains. 1950s, combined with the actual needs of study the Alnico alloy heat treatment (1951,1957). Even more of his writings, in addition to doctoral thesis mentioned before, the main nickel - cobalt single crystal magnetic \"(1936),\" the isotropic ferromagnet magnetic \"(1937),\" permalloy crystal powder the pattern Figure \"(1939),\" the magnetite crystal magnetic structure \"(1940), the preliminary report of the permanent ferroalloy heat treatment (1951) and\" Lu the provincial judge Ancient V by magnetic heat treatment after anisotropic magnetic \"(1957 ), academic articles. Comments <br>: the development of the cause of the physics and magnetic, scientific planning, development and scientific cultivation of talents to make an important contribution to <br>'
