Two days ago, before the debate in the House of Representatives began impeachment, Livingston threw out a \"bomb\", publicly admitted had \"deviated from his 33-year marriage journey and lost. He said today that he was no longer fit to lead the House of Representatives, so I decided to resign. More compelling to him as he asked Clinton to resign, \"I have to set an example that I hope President Clinton can learn. Livingston&#39;s resignation on Clinton to cause any kind of pressure is hard to determine, but Livingston fallen due to the scandal and a political figure to the political atmosphere in Washington will bring no small influence. Saturday third episode, when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives rejected the Democratic Party once again raised the \"discipline\" Clinton alternative and start impeachment vote, more than two hundred House Democrats Minority Leader Ge Puha special led out of the Capitol to indicate that the discontent and protest of the Republican Party, the Republican and Democratic parties of the political struggle is vividly unfolded. <br> Clinton did not watch the House of Representatives After their impeachment vote, he was to work together in the Oval Office and the pastor in prayer.

First Lady Hillary Clinton was and daughter Qieer Xi with excruciating period of time spent in the White House&#39;s official residence. In the House of Representatives after the completion of the impeachment vote, Clinton and his wife Hillary came to the South Lawn of the White House arm in arm, surrounded by Democratic lawmakers, Clinton was impeached after the first public speech. His speech when the mood is very calm. He first thanked the members of the Democratic Party, and a small number of Republican lawmakers and the American people on his own, families and their support of the government. He said that the error committed his private life, he has to take responsibility, and also invited members of Congress and their one looking for a reasonable, bipartisan and proportionate \"punishment, but the way the House Republicans rejected the hope The Senate can accept. He hoped that this issue in the Senate as soon as possible \"constitutional and fair way to solve\". In particular, he stressed, \"We must stop the destruction of the political game\". In his speech, Clinton again ruled out the voluntarily resign possible.

Before the Senate impeachment trial, Clinton is most worried about growing calls for his resignation from Clinton&#39;s impeachment by the House of Representatives after the latest poll results, Clinton can breathe a sigh of relief, the United States for more than half of the people still hope Clinton continue to finish the presidency, people were satisfied with his work held up to 61%. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> Clinton&#39;s impeachment by the House of Representatives does not mean that Clinton had been driven to the White House. In fact, the House of Representatives by Clinton the terms of the two impeachment charges against Clinton. According to the Constitution of the United States, the U.S. Senate will hold a trial will make a final ruling on the allegations. Senate trial and criminal trials in the United States similar trial was presided over by the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William - Rehnquist, The 100 senators juror, and the House of Representatives, Republican lawmakers plaintiff, Clinton accused. Finally, by the 100 senators vote to decide whether to set up two of Clinton&#39;s impeachment allegations. If two-thirds of the senators believe that the allegation is true, then the time Clinton really from the White House was driven out. 100 Senate seats, Republicans accounted for 55 seats, 45 seats in the Democratic Party. Senate need to have at least 67 members identified impeachment guilty to Clinton&#39;s removal, it is necessary to at least 12 Democratic senators Backward Republican camp is unlikely for the moment. However, the political changes in Washington are often eye-popping, political analysts here Clinton will be able to ride off this road in the Senate is not overly optimistic. The Senate trial regardless of the outcome of the impeachment of the House of Representatives in the 19th has become a career wiped away a black point of President Clinton and a big \"The Scarlet Letter\". <br> <br> <br>'
