'cont'=>'(Rat-year winter and early nine), December 19, 1996, the American television program different levels. <br> 1996 12 19, is designed to help parents guide their children in the United States to watch TV set shows hierarchical approach is formally introduced. However, this system has just unveiled, and triggered a fierce debate in film and television. television classification system <br> U.S. for can be described as \"long-awaited\" Earlier this year, several major U.S. television networks, as well as some of Hollywood&#39;s big-name program producers are forced by social pressure and adolescents the voices of parents, in principle, agreed to develop more and more television programs beyond the traditional ethics like the movie is divided into different levels, to facilitate the parents to guide their children to watch TV. (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> in February of this year, the United States enacted the new Electronic Communications Act requires the classification of television programs, new TV production coupled with visual chip (V CHIP). This chip enables parents to choose to temporarily cut off or connectivity of a TV channel. Was ready to fully re-election Clinton will be concerned about the growth of young people as one of the important program, not only the TV giants summoned to the White House to discuss the matter, also highly commended the open field station this TV chip is a Lee Quo great riding out the invention, since that time, American society has been concerned about the formulation of the system, particularly those concerned with how much the difference between it and the existing 28-year-old film classification approach. <br> this way new program is divided into six levels according to the different ages. Since the beginning of mid-1997, except the United States all the upper-left corner of the TV screen will display the level of the program is playing, news and sports programs. Specific, he told the Y-level representation suitable for children of all developmental stages, and even the 2-6 year-old children can watch; the Y7 level suitable for children over the age of 7, the program may include mild entertainment violence may be a bit scary ; the G level suitable for people of all ages, there is no violence and pornography; the PG level representation need parental guidance to watch children&#39;s audience, which may have menial jobs, limited violence, language and sexual meaning; 14 to remind parents to pay attention to, children under the age of 14 should not watch; M-class program obviously violent and pornographic content only suitable for adults to watch. This set of measures is exactly the same with the Film Classification Act, it is actually planned by Hollywood grading. <br> set of approaches had not introduced a heated debate. This classification is still too vague to take a critical stance on social accused, they suggested that the content should be grading, rather than focus on the age, should indicate the severity of the violence program, pornographic language or lens, so as to make the parents clearer concept. They also accused the television network or issue self-grading but, unlike a movie, as determined by an independent committee be irresponsible. <br> TV giants opinionated. They said to imitate the movie, this classification method has been familiar to and accepted by the general public. The self-grading is because television production too fast, even if the TV station is self-grading, every day should be approved at least 2000 program, this film to be cumbersome and more. <br> U.S. President Bill Clinton in the White House that day with the television networks and Hollywood giants met his smooth things out, this approach than there is no way a big step. The public should be given the time of the 10 months of the television industry to make adjustments and improvements. U.S. TV bosses admit can make appropriate changes in the established way. <br>'
