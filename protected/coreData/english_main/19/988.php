'cont'=>'January 19, 1629 (, Boshin In the twelfth lunar month 26), Bo Sisa non-dynasty emperor Abbasid I of the death. Abbasid I Abbs <br> I the Great (1571 -1629 on January 19, 2011) the Abbasid I was called the Great, Bo Sisa non-dynasty emperor (1587-1629 reign) During his reign, Safi dynasty reached the peak of national power. (Today in History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> these places are so comfortable, not thieves and robbers - on this point, not a Christian country can contrast compared to - and that can only land with cash through the Persian - a British businessman Persian reviews under the governance of the Abbasid I <br> in Iranian history, three of the most brilliant era, the ancient Persian Empire, the Sassanid Sa non-dynasty era from the most recent Safi dynasty, is a contribution many in its heyday of the king of Abbasid I (the title \"the Great\") Abbasid and broad perspective emperors, in the history of the development of the Islamic Suleiman, Akbar par. He not only affect the history of Iran, and the East and West of the Age of Discovery exchanges play a significant role. non-dynasty ancestor <br> Sa Sa non-teaching group Sa non-small founded in the 14th century. Sa non-small sixth generation descendant of Ismail when loyal Turkmen tribal army \"Red Riding Hood Army embraced, swept Persian earth overthrow Aries dynasty rule, almost equal to the Ottoman Empire border, he established the dynasty known as the Safi dynasty (1502-1722). Rely on horse sword tribal army can destroy a medieval fortress, but do nothing Ottoman army with guns cannons and other advanced weapons. Ismail, in his later years defeat at the hands of the Turks, (L $ dj而.c身m) lost the territory of Kurdistan, Azerbaijan. Defeat at the the Ismail heir 坢禎鎮佴ぱ I era, and under the iron heel of Suleiman, Mesopotamia swallowed by the Ottoman Empire. <br> into Red Hat Army also defeated Red Hat Army \"used to describe the pre-political Safi dynasty is exactly that. Turkmen the Red Hat Army is the mainstay of the creation and expansion of the Safi Empire, through the founding era hero, with the contradiction between the Persian ruler, and their mutual strife became political instability factor. Abbasid father Yehuda Banda this profound experience, Huda Banda by Red Hat generals pushed large bit, but suffering from the Red Hat Army hijack, his queen and eldest son has with Red Hat Army generals confrontation? s. This is the situation before the Abbasid Sideng Ji. <br> Abbasid prince identity early town Khorasan and Herat region. Excellent candidates in the Persian royal Turkmen generals intricate contradictions, he became acceptable to all aspects. In 1587, the Abbasid support Khan Turkmen great nobles ancient ascended the throne as emperor, the the fatuous father Yehuda Banda sent to \"overlord\" limbo. 18-year-old Abbasid, acutely aware of his main threat, domestic vagaries of of Turkmen Red Hat Army generals, and abroad west feud Ottoman Empire and decisions based on the eastern side of Uzbek tribal army. The primary task <br> to stabilize their rule. Abbasid first, with the power of ancient Khan, to track down his mother and Wang Xiong? S case on the grounds eradicate some rebellious Turkmen aristocracy, and the repression of a rebellion conspiracy and then recovered a large fief. Then, let the ancient sweat this ambitious hero tasted the taste of \"Tusigoupeng\" remove Guri Khan Abbasid power. Abbasid strengthen imperial power led reconstruction of the Safi dynasty ruled structure. Central to the establishment of the highest advisory body meeting, convened by the king, representatives designated by the king; administrative removal of the two positions of the regent and Red Hat Army Commander-in-Chief, to strengthen the status of the Prime Minister; improve the province system, confidence in the Governor by the prince or pro; gradually cut fan Turkmen aristocratic private domain in the emperor himself under control. Preparedness minority dissent, Abbasid some ethnic groups, such as Kurds forced to go into exile from their home countries. Abbasid Great <br> most dramatic reforms in the military. His military reform is divided into two parts, the \"modernization\", the help of the British adventurer Shelly Brothers, the Persian army from an army with a tribal atmosphere, the development to have guns, cannon and other equipment of the new army, artillery up to one million people, to become the main Persian army; the other hand, the \"imperial power\", change Red Hat Army \"dominant situation, to absorb a large number of Muslims of the Caucasus nation army Turkmen aristocracy no longer privileged discretionary control by the emperor of all the officers and men. Like other West Asian countries, the Abbasid developed an elite Guard directly under the emperor himself. at the same time the Abbasid effectiveness of the reform in <br> gradually emerging, coincided with a great international situation. Uzbek tribes into a failed state, Abbasid took the opportunity to send troops to the attack, captured from Khorasan to the rivers and mountains of Herat, the Amu Darya south of his sphere of influence, the Afghans to him concede defeat. Then, in the face of the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the Abbasid wash the Persians centuries shame, after 10 years of bitter struggle, forced the Turks in 1613 signed the \"Treaty of Istanbul, to recover the ancient capital of Tabriz and Kurdistan, Azerbaijan other places, the 1623 expedition, again and recovered throughout Mesopotamia, including Baghdad, Basra, after five years. This the heyday the Safi dynasty territory, balance is fully backward in the battle with the enemies of the Ottoman Empire, the Persian party. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> Abbasid Great, another significant influence in the religious aspect. Safi dynasty founding emperor Ismail once fierce means of implementation of the Shiites, persecuted Sunni, Shia in Persia prevailed. Abbasid by a more moderate way of fostering Shiite, he had all of their own private property donated to the Shiite, also walking nearly a month homage to the tomb of the Shiite elders. 42 years after he imperceptibly, Iran has finally become a radical Shiite Muslim country. Since the rise of Islam, Iran was as a with the integration of many civilizations of the Middle East, but the since Safi dynasty, Shia and Iran the same things on both sides of the Sunni Muslim countries distinguish from as Iran The unique banner maintain the independence of this country. the Great <br> Abbasid era is the Age of Discovery, when Western European navigator to pour. In the south, the Portuguese occupied Hormuz Island, the development of trade across Indian Ocean as a base, the Abbasid tolerance and promotions; in the north, the Abbasid take the initiative to send missions to visit Russia in order to promote bilateral trade. Later, the Abbasid British help to recapture Hormuz Island to the mainland port Abbasid Port as the main window for. The British replaced the Portuguese position, the Abbasid also gave the British many promotions and rights, and even allow them to run workshops in Persia. The growth of foreign trade has also led to the development of the domestic handicrafts, Persian seeds of capitalism, Abbasid important handicraft sector in the state-controlled, which strengthened national strength, but hinder the capital of the principle of free competition. Abbasid also sent missions to visit the Western European nations, [l $ dj而.身r阱] the establishment of diplomatic relations, which the German emperor, on the bilateral alliance against Turkey was interested. Abbasid actively developing relationship with Western Christian countries there is a reason, the main purpose is to find allies to attack Turkey, but like him in the East-West exchanges actively Oriental monarch, or rare. Abbasid, <br> another achievement, that is, construction of the new capital of Isfahan city, this city is located in the hinterland of the Persian attack range away from the Ottoman Empire in 1598 moved the capital here and large-scale construction. After several generations, won a reputation as \"the world&#39;s half in Isfahan\". <br> due to the above effects, the Abbasid I was included in the ranking. His ranking in the championship is better with him the same type of Suleiman, Akbar, mainly because Bo Sisa non-dynasty status in the history of the world can not compare with the Ottoman Empire, the Indian Mughal, and continued The time is smaller than the latter two. He ranked No. 92 in the chart. <br> Review: Abbasid I in dealing with the Europeans was a very pro-active in this regard for the needs of the Sunni Muslim attack from Turkey, on the other hand, because he is flourishing under his dominion Empire of confidence. Exchanges of civilization, always confident the party to take a proactive stance. Before the industrial revolution of the latter half of the 18th century, Europeans all over the world and there is no obvious advantage, the Abbasid I era Persia, is one of the world&#39;s major powers. <br>'
