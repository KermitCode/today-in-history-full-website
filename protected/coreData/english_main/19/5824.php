'cont'=>'June 19, 1623 May 22, (Guihai years), Blaise Pascal, French mathematician, physicist and thinker was born. In In 1623, 19, was born in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dome, France Province Town. Pascal no formal schooling. His mother died at age 4, by highly educated, as a father and two sisters of the government officials responsible for his education and upbringing. His father was a respected mathematician, carefully education, Pascal hours proficient in Euclidean geometry, he found the first 32 theorems of Euclidean, and the order is completely correct. 12-year-old found alone internal angles of a triangle is equal to 180 degrees, began under the tutelage of his father to study mathematics. 1631 the Pascal family moved to Paris. Father found Pascal amount to anything like him participate in the Paris mathematicians and physicists academic activities of the Group (the predecessor of the Paris Academy of Sciences), he was 16 years old, full of eye-opener, 17 years old Pascal wrote high level of mathematics \"conic section &#39;article, he studies the results of Dezhaerge classic work on integrated projective geometry. <br> 1631 the Pascal family moved to Paris. Yi Jina their own education the Pascal and often class geometer with Paris as Malan Mason, Gassendi, Dezhaerge and Descartes conversation, small Pascal also showed high mathematical talent . At age 11, Pascal wrote an article about the relationship between the vibration and sound, which makes Yi Jina worried that he will affect the learning of Greek and Latin, he forbade him to study mathematics before the age of 15. One day, Yi Jina found Blaise (then 12 years old) independent proof of the corners of the triangle is equal to two right angles to the wall with a piece of coal. Since then, Pascal allows learning Euclidean geometry. <br> small Pascal with Dezhaerge the especially interested. The thought Dezhaerge, Pascal 16-year-old wrote \"On the conic. This book has been largely lost, but an important conclusion to be retained, \"Pascal&#39;s theorem. Descartes this book has been highly praised, but did not dare believe it from the hands of a 16-year-old boy in 1641 Pascal family moved to Rouen. From 1642 to 1644 to help the father to do the tax calculations, Pascal invented the adder, which is the world&#39;s first calculator, now on display in a French museum. In 1610, he accepted religious doctrine, but remains committed to scientific experiments, to 1653, Pascal focus research on vacuum and hydrostatic made a series of major achievements. <br> 1647 returned to Paris to live. Torricelli&#39;s theory, he conducted a number of experiments, the experiment of 1647 had shocked the whole of Paris, he said: the fundamental guiding ideology of his experiments against the traditional concept of \"Nature abhors a vacuum\". 1647 to 1648, he published a papers on vacuum problem. 1648 Pascal conceived and different the highly atmospheric pressure measured experiments on the same area, found that the law, the atmospheric pressure increases with the height reduced. In the past few years, Pascal experiment constantly made new discoveries, and has a number of significant inventions, such as the invention of the syringe, the hydraulic press, improved Torricelli mercury barometer. Atmospheric pressure changes from 1649 to 1651, Pascal with his collaborator Pierre (Perier) detailed measurements of the same place, to become a pioneer in using a barometer for weather forecast. The 1651 Pascal began to sum up the results of his experiments, Proceedings of fluid balance and the weight of the air \"written in 1654, was officially published in 1663. After Pascal into theological studies in 1655, he entered the theological the center draped special barrier Al. His departure from the skepticism that the emotional and rational knowledge is not reliable, to arrive at the belief overriding conclusion. <br> 1646 years ago Pascal a Catholic. Due to an illness of his father, so that he had contact with a more esoteric religion, a great influence on his later life. The Pascal and mathematician Fermat communication, they work together to solve a problem gamblers and amateur philosopher sent a high society, he eludes his gamble to throw some kind of combination of the three dice why do you always lose money. In the process they solve this problem, laid the foundation of the modern theory of probability. Made many contributions in his fleeting life, the biggest contribution in mathematics and physics. In order to test the theory of the Italian physicist Galileo and Torricelli in 1646, produced a mercury barometer, atmospheric experiments repeatedly in Clermont-Ferrand top of the hill overlooking Paris, fluid dynamics and hydrostatic paved the way. In order to improve the air pressure of the Torricelli juice experiment, he invented in Pascal&#39;s law on the basis of a syringe, and the creation of a hydraulic press. <br> his research and writings on vacuum, and more to improve his popularity. He grew weak constitution, leaving the sick because of overwork. Yet it is sick of 1651 to 1654, he nervously scientific work, written in the papers about fluid balance, the weight of the air density and arithmetic triangle paper became the basis of the theory of probability. Between 1655 and 1659, also wrote many religious writings. His later years, it was suggested that his findings were published Cycloid he being immersed in the scientific interest, but in February 1659, sicker, so he can not work properly, and be content with a devout religious life . Finally, a huge pain in the death. <br> 1662 Pascal&#39;s death, aged 39 years old. After the Memorial human Pascal, named after his name to the pressure of the unit, referred to as \"Pa\". <br>'
