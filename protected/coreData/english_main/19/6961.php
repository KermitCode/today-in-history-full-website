'class'=>4,
'cont'=>'(Guihai June tenth day), July 19, 1983, the French painter and sculptor Edgar Degas was born. <br> <br> Edgar Degas (1834.7.19 ~ 1917.9.27), was born in Paris in 1834, formerly known as Edgar according to Turiel ¡¤ Germanic Degas (Edgar Hilaire Germain de Gas). He was born in a family of financial capitalists, his grandfather was a painter, so he born and grew up in a very caring family of art. After graduating from high school, Degas, applied for the School of Fine Arts, he was studying in Italy Italian art, especially the art of the Renaissance. At the same time, he - Auguste Dominique &#8226; Ingres (Jean-Suguste Dominique Ingres ,1780-1867), a studio proud of protege Louis &#8226; Lamothe (Louis Lamott) where to study painting. Then copying the Degas the 15-16 century paintings and sketches; When he returned to Paris, he has learned first-hand Ingres Painting good practices, kung fu deep sketch connoisseur. This sketch is a sketch of a neoclassical, a college learning the sketch (academic), Edward Manet (Edouard Manet ,1832-1883), Pierre &#8226; Auguste &#8226; Renoir (Pierre-Auguste Renoir ,1841-1919), Paul &#8226; Cezanne (Paul Cezanne ,1839-1906) soon to rise up against this sketch, but a Degas its attitude is different, he is very worship neoclassical sketch. Degas a natural bent sketch, he likes the slim, coherent and clear lines, this line is the elegant style of the guarantee and the kind of beauty, the only way to achieve his admiration. Lines became his desire. The use of on-line, he reached a wonderful flower pen point of Ingres disciple and his followers do not have a match. but soon <br> Degas acuity of intellect made him aware of a new wave of art airflow, is that \"realism\". But this theory advocates abandoning the ancient Greek ideal of beauty, and replaced by simple, sincere performance seen things. Close to the ideal of beauty is not detached from reality, Degas creative approach is the use of clean lines and use of light and shade skills. If you want to depict reality, we must make the way to obey the image of personalization, which is painting portraits. The accurate portrait of Degas youth his sketch of faith, excellent skills and delicate feeling overly conformist. Such as: painting \"Belene a\" description of the painter&#39;s uncle and aunt and two cousin. Japanese theme of complexity of the frame of this picture, people re-imagine the weight of the task. This is a realistic scene. But here the painter failed to show a sense of space, very delicate sketch did not show a sense of volume, harmonious and gentle colors (sky blue, white and black) tone effect did not reach painter all the attention focused on the characters portrayal on. The figure does not seem to pose, but can not say that the painter quickly grasped them. Performance aristocratic families gentle \"good upbringing\" painting their uncommunicative law-abiding (painter), they kind of never act rashly insufferably arrogant and defiant air. Nuanced performance artist aunt looks, which can replace in the painter seems beautiful, but it lacks the life convincing. All the characters, as in Degas&#39;s minds, evoke a feeling of awe, the entire painting its excellent sketch awe. This feeling of awe is so strong, that did not leave any room for artistic appeal. <br> let us admire Degas the cotton procurement firm creation after the 1872 New Orleans trip. The conception of this painting is the description of a contemporary life scene to follow fashion created by Manet and his realist painting the Friends as well as the future of Impressionism ¢Ù painter. This is a set of family portraits, painting space and the environment the furnishings are gradually to expand depths, Degas past have never done this before. In the handling of this type of theme, color is often of great significance, but Degas seems to ignore it; very tacky colors, such as red of the walls. In addition to painting portraits are like, but the arrangement of the figures is entirely accidental, the composition is very loose. The Degas attempt as painting like a realist painter, but he does not believe the realism; result, he stressed that the nature of the subject matter of the vulgar. Cotton procurement firm \"marks Degas style development that can be described as the end of the academic realist period. During this period, he was doing \"form of captives. However, in some of Degas sketch, also some of the theme and mood to prove that he can gradually get rid of this captive status, these themes and the mood in the next period of his creative development. <br> since 1862, Degas began to occur in horse racing interest, this theme to provide him with a number of how many finally complete. Creation \"horse race\" between 1877-1880, it is easy to see that the: Degas observation method has undergone a radical change. Lines just vague show, did not damage the relationship based on color shading arrangements. Color form a unified whole, in the whole, the tone of prominent rider stature with the tone of the house on the horizon is almost exactly the same. From this visual image of unity, from painting \"integrity\", also produced a sense of all the objects in the painting can breathe free air. The body is the lack of three-dimensional space is not manifested, but that is no defect, because these factors do not affect the integrity of the impression. The prospects that back by Frame truncated character, is the painter an unnecessary inventiveness. However, these riders joint and active and color of the overall effect of their coat shiny mottled yellow, pink, red, light blue, green, blue, gray and yellow-gray, very harmonious with background on the piece. This effect is achieved, Degas figures immersed in the rendering, it is easy to breathe the atmosphere. Can imagine, he is from memory rather than the outer light painting this picture; portray his memory, not an abstract shape, but \"Xingse one specific image. <br> We all know that Degas is a painter known for painting ballerinas. Indeed, none of any other subject matter make him so fascinated, seems to have failed to bring him to create his own style, he hopes to draw a sense of space, draw the three-dimensional shape of the impression from the most unexpected point of view, Therefore, he likes to select a theme from the ballets, rather than select a theme from the outdoor scenes. Watch rehearsals, Degas have the opportunity to see the the richest changing body posture from various. When looking down from above the stage, he could see the young girls dancing or rest, but also to study the complex shortening and stage lighting effect in human shape. \"Waiting appearance\" is one of the Degas sketches with crayons. Painting in the layout of a casual look. Some dancers, we only see their legs, others only see their body. Only one character can completely see her posture is vastly complex. We see her from above her head forward down lower, left hand grasping the letter of the ankle, an intentionally relaxed look. Degas&#39;s paintings there is no story. The reason why he ballerina interested, not because they are beautiful girls. He does not seem to care about their feelings, he observed to the impression that the main recognized by the kind of apathy and objective attitude of the surrounding landscape to observe them. He is concerned about the interaction of light and shade on the body shape can be used to the way of the performance movement or space. the <br> \"ballet theater lounge is a fascinating miniature painting, the composition is very good, expand the depth of space was also very good. Neoclassical interaction described detailed, beautifully emphasized dancer&#39;s grace. The main tone gray, gray-blue, dark yellow. But when we see enough of this picture, we will feel that it is not a masterpiece. <br> Degas in his later years the main effort the theme of a woman naked. He work harder than anyone else in the nude painting freed from the academic tradition of detention. He constantly research body, light, movement, human organs, and its role. He attempted to make a man - beast portrait painter, but his appreciation of the human machine and its action and vitality is so great, so cold rational idea in his image completely disappeared. Not only that, these images also reflect his enthusiasm, sometimes he&#39;s all struggling. Beginning in 1880, <br> Degas the main painting toner painting. Toner painting so he painted color sketch method, and in the case without prejudice to sketch and color effects. \"Tub\" is a light and physiognomy toner painting masterpiece. after more than ten years <br> Degas painting a painting of the same subject matter \"Bathing\", this painting, chalk lines painted not so uniform, body worn not so smooth, and the color was more rich, more profound. It appears naked women is just as colorful star (white, yellow, blue, and purple) rain-like. Shows, Degas two decades after its creation, not only made his unprecedented wealth and color effects, and in the creation of his unique body, his use of color to overcome the isolation of the body, so the body penetration color flow.
