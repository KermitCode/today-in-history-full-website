'cont'=>'March 19, 1998 (February 21) Tiger years, plankton fulminant propagation caused by the \"red tide\" caused massive deaths of fish in Hong Kong waters. <br> 1998 plankton fulminant breeding caused the \"red tide\" caused massive deaths of fish in Hong Kong waters. <br> \"red tide\", has been hailed as the \"red specter\", also called \"harmful algal blooms\" red tide, also known as red tide, is an anomaly in the marine ecosystem. It is by the the seaweed family in the red tide algae outbreaks in specific environmental conditions to proliferation caused. Seaweed is a huge family, in addition to some macroalgae, many of which are very small plants, and some single-celled plants. Because of the different types and quantities of red tide organisms, seawater can be presented in different colors of red, yellow, green, and so on. <br> occurrence of red tide, the water turns red, and gather a large number of red tide organisms in fish gills, Fish and suffocation from lack of oxygen; <br> red tide organisms died, algae consume a lot of body in the process of decomposition of dissolved oxygen in the water, fish and other marine life die from lack of oxygen, while also release large amounts of harmful gases and toxins, serious pollution of the marine environment, the normal ocean ecosystems have been seriously destruction; (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> fish swallowed large amounts of toxic algae. <br> PH value of seawater also elevated viscosity increased, non-red tide algae plankton death, decay; red tide algae due to the explosive proliferation and excessive accumulation of a large number of deaths. <br> red tide, under specific environmental conditions related to many factors, but an extremely important factor is the marine pollution. Contain large amounts of a variety of organic waste water discharged into the sea water, prompting seawater eutrophication, which is an important material basis of the red tide algae blooms, large number of domestic and international studies have shown that the major biological marine planktonic algae is caused by red tide, in the world more than 260 kinds of more than 4000 kinds of marine planktonic algae in the formation of red tide, which has more than 70 kinds of produce toxins. Some of the toxins they secrete can lead directly to a large number of deaths of marine life, and some can even pass through the food chain, causing food poisoning in humans. the <br> At present, the world in more than 30 countries and regions affected to varying degrees of red tide hazards, Japan is the worst-affected countries. Over the last decade, increasing marine pollution, red tide disaster in China worsening trend to the waters into a film by the a dispersed minority waters, development, victims of some of the important breeding base especially heavy. The occurrence of red tide, the harm to research and prevention, biological oceanography, chemical oceanography, physical oceanography and environmental oceanography involves a variety of disciplines, is a complex the systems engineering <br> red tide is a natural phenomenon , is caused by human factors. Man was recorded in the Old Testament Exodus \"there is a description of the red tide: the water in the river, have become a blood river smelled so bad, the Egyptians could not drink the water here a. \" In Japan, as early as documented in the the Teng original era and sickle era have red tide. 1803 Frenchman Marc Royce Capote described the Indians of the Americas Royal Bay Area night of the month black observed seawater luminous phenomenon to distinguish the mussels edible. 1831-1836 years in the the Beagle sailing record \"in Darwin documented Trichodesmium algae caused by red tide event that occurred off the coast of Brazil and Chile face. It contains, in China as early as 2,000 years ago found that the red tide phenomenon, some ancient books, literature or literary works about red tide records. Qing Dynasty Pu Songling \"Strange\" vividly documented red tide-related luminescence phenomena. <br> red tide seawater under specific environmental conditions, some phytoplankton, protozoa or bacteria outbreak proliferative or highly gathered a harmful ecological phenomenon that caused the discoloration of the water body. Red tide is a history follows the name, it is not necessarily all red, and in fact many red tide collectively. HAB CAUSE, type, and number of different, the water showing a different color, a red color, or a brick red color, green, yellow, brown, etc.. It is worth noting that some of the red tide organisms (such as Gonyaulax algae, Gymnodinium, pears dinoflagellates) caused by red tide sometimes does not cause sea water to render any particular color. <br> Reviews: red tide has become a worldwide public nuisance <br>'
