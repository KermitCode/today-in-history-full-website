News, public public outcry, the South Korean government immediately ordered the inspecting authorities to investigate the incident. Lee Hyun rain proved in the course of the investigation, former President Roh Tae-woo guardhouse room long and Security Minister, Roh Tae-woo&#39;s political capital money is a fictitious name stored in the Shinhan Bank. So, the secret funds of more than 1,000 won successive exposure. <br> In this case, the Roh Tae-woo has no escape route, (lssjt.cn) had a press conference, held on October 27 and admit secret during the 1988-1993 president to raise 500 billion won ( about $ 650 million) in secret political funds, remaining about 170 billion won is still stored in bank accounts in false names, although he burst into tears, said to feel ashamed, and he is willing to accept any form of punishment, but this The the things feel angry citizens do not believe his tears, have asked for his arrest brought to justice. (L $ dj而.身r阱) <br> scandal was made public the same day the New Politics of National Conference president Kim Dae-jung also disclosed an equally shocking news. He said that during the presidential election in 1992, Roh Tae-woo to over 26O million dollars in political funds, proved he still has reliable intelligence Roh Tae-woo was to incumbent President Kim Young-sam huge amount of political capital. Jinrun Huan, chairman of the ruling Democratic Party, that was Roh Tae-woo to Kim Young-sam campaign needs huge funds. <br> as the investigation deepens, the Democratic members of the first to expose the scandal Pu Qidong revealed that another presidential candidate, Roh Tae-woo also Kim Jong-pil, the co-president of the liberal democracy provides a huge amount of political capital, and now, Korea all the major political parties and its head rolled into the scandal. (History calls for an urgent requirement to find out the truth. Cn) <br>, President Kim Young-sam on October 30 denied having accepted the Roh Tae-woo, a huge amount of political capital, before he vowed to be fair and to identify The scandal is just to prove that his government. But the opposition immediately retaliated, they said Kim Young Sam himself with the scandal implicated, Kim Dae-jung also claimed that Kim Young Sam spent $ 1.2 billion in the 1992 presidential election, most of the money from the Roh Tae-woo. Later, Kim Young Sam admitted that he is likely to get in the 1992 presidential campaign of former President Roh Tae-woo funding, but he denied that he knew this thing say may be the Roh Tae-woo take the initiative to provide funding for the party, but he is Kim Young-sam never touched a penny. <br> now have secret funds scandal investigation has been in full swing on November 2, Roh Tae-woo also accept up to 16 hours of interrogation to the inspection hall. Roh Tae-woo, but avoid the critical issues, and did not say anything substantial, just \"do not know\" and \"forget\" to deal with. Nevertheless, the inspecting authorities have confirmed that South Korea many famous enterprises to participate in the activities of the secret transfer of funds to the bank account for the Roh Tae-woo, inspecting authorities will have to investigate about six or seven companies to engage in love Roh secret political The source of the funds. In addition, prosecutors began investigating the problem Roh Tae-woo family assets and offshore deposits and real estate investment. <br> In fact, the secret political funds in South Korea can be said to be an open secret, the political parties were feeling each other. Former South Korean President Park Chung-hee, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo is often known as the elected President of the \"lack of legitimacy\" through improper means public opinion, Roh secret political funds scandal is proof of the kind of public opinion. Raise political funds can be described as a variety of practices, the use of large national project tender to receive a certain percentage of the funds as a political capital, or some investment seminars held at the presidential palace to receive donations from the hands of business people, or simply to reach out to businesses to ask for accumulation The funds used to maintain the operation of the ruling party, to strengthen their rule, give yourself go backward. These things are clearly a lot of people, but no one dared to come forward to reveal. August 1 this year, the the Korean General Services Executive Xu tin Jae said in an interview with reporters: \"one of the former presidents to discuss the accounts in false names of 400 billion won into the real-name account through an agent, has aroused great social repercussions, but get burned because of lack of evidence, he was released three days after the Executive office of the General Services. <br> 1992 Kim Young-sam&#39;s civilian government after the establishment of, and actively carry out anti-corruption movement, announced the bad habit of surgery to the political and economic collusion and the implementation of the financial real-name system, the property of the open public officer in Korean society whipped up a new wind, but in Korea, the deep-rooted in the political arena of money politics a long time, just as Roh Tae-woo said, \"domination funds received from the economic sector in South Korea is the ethos of political culture and electoral The usual practice. Need costly campaign alone countries that political funds can not be carried out, so hundreds of hundreds of political parties won election funding come from self-evident. <br> the Roh Tae-woo secret political funds scandal, Kim Young-sam implement financial real-name system is undoubtedly a heavy blow, exposed the \"financial, real-name system\" exists and leakage along. <br> In addition, some people think the Roh Tae-woo rely on corporate donations is difficult to accumulate such a large sum of money, the money is likely to accepting corporate bribes. Opinion formers think that the enterprises such unfair means of competition is bound to impact on the culture of fair competition. In addition, the exposure of the secret funds also exposed the vulnerability of the Korean tax administration. Although these secret funds outflow from large enterprises, but there is little evidence to prove that these enterprises are all secretly possession of funds of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income paragraph. It is said that the money in the Kim Young-sam government also flow into the pockets of many decision-makers in addition to the president outside. [L $ dj而.c身m] swallow <br> enterprises in the political capital, Roh Tae-woo apology speech, business people argue that the \"donations\" Is \"spontaneous heartfelt Contributions in the true sense of the land money \"? Political collusion with the business community of this relationship for a long time, in the case of government master tax, financial, and other policy instruments, corporate survival strategies can only be obedient political power. If you can not participate in the projects of the government to give preferential policies, will be eliminated in the competition in the business world. Enterprises to provide political funds can be said that the South Korean government-led economic era legacy shadow, the shadow until now can not erase. <br> In political terms, this secret funds scandal will already be in the midst of the ruling party worse. Because, in the local elections in June this year, the Democratic Party has failed miserably to rival the situation is beginning to show the \"gold\" of the South Korean political arena, and the former President Roh Tae-woo&#39;s slush fund scandal undoubtedly gave Kim Young-sam with to the enormous pressure. (Lssdjt.com) <br> now on how to deal with the problem of Roh Tae-woo, Kim Young-sam is faced with a difficult problem. If the arrest Roh Tae-woo, it will set a precedent for the arrest of former President in the constitutional history of Korea, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party may therefore appear internal division does not say more deadly, which will likely already irritating the hubbub of the ruling and opposition parties up and down 1992 the presidential election funding problems also may be exposed, since the party for the upcoming parliamentary elections in the next year, China is undoubtedly an adverse factor. If you do not arrest Roh Tae-woo, public opinion will never promised, the opposition parties will also take the attack on the ruling party. Therefore, how to dispose of the Roh Tae-woo and the chaos caused by the scandal, will have a great impact on Kim Young-sam regime. <br>'
