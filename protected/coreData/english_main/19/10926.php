'cont'=>'November 19, 1991 (, Xinwei October 14), the United States proposed a new \"Star Wars\" plan. November 19, 2011 <br> 1991, the Senate and the House of the U.S. Congress recently after consultations, the preliminary approval of a new \"Star Wars\" program, whose main content is based on $ 25 billion of capital, deployment of ground-based anti-missile system to protect the United States from possible missile attacks in the 1990s. Press here pointed out that, once this plan is approved, the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (commonly known as the \"Star Wars\" program) from the research stage to the actual deployment phase. (Lsjt.org) <br> this new program eight years ago, President Reagan proposed the concept of the \"Star Wars\" program is different, much smaller scale. In 1983, Reagan proposed his Strategic Defense Initiative, the establishment of large-scale, new anti-missile defense system, based directed energy weapons in space and on the ground to intercept and destroy incoming missiles warhead. Envisaged implementation of multilayer intercept enemy missiles flying will be, in order to achieve a degree of \"seamless\". To this end, the Pentagon set up the Strategic Defense Council, the huge annual funding for research and development. But this plan is too costly, many technical problems, repeated criticism of the military and political circles. After the Bush administration took office, told the Strategic Defense Initiative has been adjusted, the concept of a \"brilliant pebbles\" that focus on the deployment of a large number of small high intelligence in space the interceptor missile interceptor the other nuclear missiles as \"Planet World War II first-phase implementation plan. <br> Now the new plan is different from the original plan. First, for anti-missile defense interceptor missiles will be ground-based, rather than based on space-based. Analysts here believe that this plan was adopted, the performance of the \"Patriot\" anti-missile missiles in the Gulf War because a lot of people feel good, so that the ground-based interceptor missiles can be more realistic to implement the anti-missile defense function. Allegedly the proposed interceptor missiles in speed, flight distance and accuracy far more than the \"Patriot\" missiles. According to the plan, the United States intends to 100 interceptor missiles deployed in North Dakota, Grand Forks Air Force Base in 1996, the first 5-6 of the same base, after which they established in other districts. Strategic Defense Bureau estimates, the first base cost of nearly $ 10 billion, to 6 base total cost of $ 25 billion, but the scientific community, the estimated total cost of more than $ 60 billion. <br> Second, the goal of the new plan is the implementation of a \"limited defense, focus is the preparedness\" accident \"and\" country \"is not responsible for the missile attacks, rather than a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union . Allegedly, with the political changes in the Soviet Union, the United States on the proliferation of missiles and nuclear weapons is growing concern, the task of the new plan is the the defense limited number of incoming missiles, rather than Reagan&#39;s former defense envisaged the Soviet Union, thousands of warheads offensive . <br> However, the new plan can be achieved, there are still many uncertain factors. Dissenting critics argue that the so-called \"missile attacks almost impossible accident occurred, and in this century, is expected to not have a so-called\" responsible nations \"may have can be a threat to the United States safety of long-range missiles. Therefore, in future discussions of the budget allocations for the \"do more with no actual need\" ABM new plan will be fierce quarrel. <br> This new plan also raised the problem of a conflict with the 1972 ABM Treaty. According to the Soviet Union and the United States signed the treaty, the parties can only build a missile base, if the United States plans to establish a 5-6 anti-missile base, is bound to renegotiate modify the terms of the treaty with the Soviet Union. Experts here believe that the treaty is one of the cornerstones of arms control, such as modifications to any lifting the ban, and some restrictive clauses, the consequences are difficult to imagine. Therefore, regardless of the \"Star Wars\" plan to a new guise, the necessity and the possibility will cause controversy at home and abroad. <br>'
