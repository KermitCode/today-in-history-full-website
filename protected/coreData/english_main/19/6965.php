'cont'=>'The (Rat June fourth day), July 19, 1996, Karadzic announced its withdrawal from the political arena. <br> U.S. government of Bosnia and Herzegovina envoy Richard Holbrooke announced the morning of July 19, 1996, in Belgrade, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has resigned from all leadership positions. Marked Karadzic&#39;s political future was eventually draw to an end. <br> Holbrooke held for up to 10 hours of talks with the Republic of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic after the announcement. Holbrooke said Karadzic and several other senior Serb officials signed an agreement, Milosevic, as the presence of witnesses. Under the agreement, Karadzic will abstain from all positions of political influence, including the post of chairman of the Serb ruling Democratic Party. He will no longer appear in the public field station, as well as radio, television and other media, and does not participate in the Bosnia-Herzegovina held its stem September 14 general election. <br> forcing Karadzic completely withdraw from the Serb political life, Bosnia-Herzegovina general election to be held as scheduled, Holbrooke&#39;s visit to the important mission of the former Yugoslavia. <br> from the 16th Holbrooke between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia shuttle visit, held talks with Izetbegovic, Tudjman and President Milosevic , which held two rounds of talks with Milosevic, as long as more than 14 hours. <br> once Karadzic ally in the war in Bosnia, Milosevic. In December last year, Milosevic on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs to the peace agreement signed in Paris. Under the peace agreement, the Hague, the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia accused of war criminals Karadzic may not hold public office, shall not participate in the Bosnia-Herzegovina general election. Forced by the pressure of the United States and its Western allies, Karadzic at the end of last month and earlier this month announced to resign from the office of President of the Bosnian Serbs not to participate in the Bosnia-Herzegovina general election. However, he still holds the post of chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia. The United States and other countries, this shows that the Bosnian Serbs did not fully implement the peace agreement, Karadzic constitutes a major obstacle to the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) officials responsible for overseeing the general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Karadzic did not fully withdraw from the Serb political life, the scheduled start date of the election campaign was forced to be postponed by 14 days to 19 days, and there may be again postponed. Bosnian Muslim government has also repeatedly said that if Karadzic continued to serve as the duties of the President of the Serb Democratic Party, the Muslim government would boycott the elections. The problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a diplomatic trump card in the Clinton administration, if the stalled peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will undoubtedly adversely affect President Clinton&#39;s re-election campaign this year. It is in this context, Holbrooke repeatedly in Belgrade Milosevic applied. <br> Holbrooke emphasized that, since Milosevic to sign the peace agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, then he has the responsibility and obligation to the implementation of the peace agreement, the relevant provisions, especially in Karadzic&#39;s go to stay on the issue, he should play a special and important role. Otherwise, the United States and other Western countries to impose more stringent economic sanctions will FRY. He also made it clear that if Karadzic continued to serve as chairman of the Serb Democratic Party, the Democratic Party will be prohibited from participating in general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the same time, the US-led NATO threatened that if diplomatic efforts do not work, NATO does not rule out the possibility of taking military action to Karadzic. <br> Milosevic FRY do not want the risk of further sanctions, but they can not easily make concessions and compromises, because to do so would have been Karadzic, the political fate of the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb strongly The opposition, he faced great political risk. <br> two sides bargain, and ultimately made some concessions. The United States is no longer insist will send Karadzic to The Hague War Crimes Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations, also no longer insist Karadzic must leave the Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milosevic is willing to do the work of the Serbian side, prompting Karadzic completely out of the Serb political life. Face the dual pressures of the United States and President Milosevic, the Bosnian Serbs, in particular Radovan Karadzic made a wise choice, in order to avoid confrontation and conflict between the Bosnian Serbs and the United States and other Western countries further upgrade. <br> Karadzic declared completely exit the Bosnian Serb political arena, responsible for overseeing the general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#39;s European Security and Cooperation Organization announced that the Bosnian election campaign action plan from the 19th Serb Democratic Party eligible to participate in the Bosnia-Herzegovina general election. <br> people think, currently Karadzic although has announced its withdrawal from the Serb political life, but to to therefore assert his political influence within the Serbs, especially in the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina from this will completely disappear, seems premature. <br>'
