Government-designated \"educated youth\" labor a place to live, usually in remote areas or economic backwardness, the poor condition of the county. This practice soon became established policy. <br> at the time, part of the youth is \"full of blood\" into the campaign, the so-called \"pride and enthusiasm under rural\", \"keeping up with the commander of Chairman Mao, vast refining faithful. \" More urban youth is imposed by the Government to leave home to move to rural areas. Compared to its life in the city, the educated youth generally feel very hard life in the rural areas, they can not, of course, poverty in rural areas continue to receive normal knowledge of education, cultural life and almost no relationship between them and the local farmers is also far from harmonious. which <br> \"went to the countryside\" educated youth \", the most to rural\" Chaduilahu \", but there although it has also a part of farming over is & ldquo ; Production and Construction Corps paramilitary of life, their situation is very different. \"queue jumping educated youth\" \"Down to the Countryside Movement\" early, all over the country set up many of the Production and Construction Corps, a large number of \"educated youth\" to these \"Production and Construction Corps to participate in the\" settlement \". \"Production and Construction Corps,\" although \"settlement\", but non-regular forces, while both the purpose of the arrangements for unemployed urban youth employment and preparing. The end of 1968, the Sino-Soviet confrontation, Mao Zedong issued a \"universal soldiers\", \"call at any instant, to able to fight the war can win,\" prepare against natural disasters for the people \"to the nation,\" dig deep, wide grain \"series on preparing for the instructions. The city began construction of the air-raid shelter, the coastal areas of many military enterprises have moved westward.

From early 1969 to 1970, the original \"Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps,\" large-scale expansion of the establishment, while the newly formed Inner Mongolia, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hubei, 10 & ldquo ; Production and Construction Corps, \"as well as Tibet, Jiangxi, Guangxi Reclamation Division, coupled with the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, formed in the 1950s, total 12\" Production and Construction Corps and three Reclamation Division. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> 1970s, young intellectuals began to allow a variety of names in recruitment, examination, Bingtui top post, only one child, no one around, workers, peasants and students variety of nominal gradually return to the city. The late 1970s, there has been a large-scale protest, the educated youth through petitions, strikes, lying on rails, and even a hunger strike and other forms of protest strongly urge the return to the city, the most famous of which Xishuangbanna struggle. In October 1978, the National Knowledge youth went to the countryside meeting decided to stop the movement of mountains and the countryside and make proper arrangements for the educated youth back to the city and employment issues. 1979, the vast majority of educated youth coming back to the city, some of the people in the rural marriage \"settled\", will always remain in the rural areas. Someone because of fear the government permission to return to the city, so even cohabit and have children nor registration of marriage. According to statistics <br> educated youth about hundreds of thousands of people stranded in rural border areas due to various reasons. After the (Lssdjt.com) <br> tens of millions of educated youth back to the city, some officials worry that the city does not appear fit so many people and cause chaos. On the contrary, since the decision was welcomed by the National People&#39;s urban society and rural community but makes more \"harmonious\". Deng Xiaoping in the early eighties, the Government suddenly strengthen the family planning policy of the Chinese Communist Party as a reaction to the educated youth back to the city. the climbers to <br> <br> a countryside although temporarily alleviate the pressure on urban employment, Mao Zedong to take to achieve the purpose of the dissolution of the Red Guard, but tens of millions of young people, youth abandoned, countless families forcibly dismantled, the campaign resulted in all levels of social chaos. As countless scholars and experts should be young people in the country long-term farming somehow eighties knowledge dating the academic research Houjifaren phenomenon. the Countryside Movement climbers to <br> a so many urban youth exposure to China&#39;s vast rural areas, many of them have never been to before this rural, rural to understand just limited to textbooks text and government propaganda. Urban youth had been actively involved in the Cultural Revolution movement after the hard life of rural, realized that he was deceived by the use of this point completely abandoned the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary ideals have no doubts that all ideal, the Chinese society in the reform the Moral Disorder after open can be found in this part of the root cause. Later, through their own efforts, the <br> who have participated in the mountains and the countryside movement became writers, such as Shi Tiesheng, Ye Xin, Liang Xiaosheng, Zhang Chengzhi, Zhang Kangkang, etc., they have creative in their own personal experience educated youth literature. However, the more educated youth forever lost educational opportunities, they bear the brunt of the influx of laid-off in the 1990s, often working unit cuts and unemployment. The the campaign <br> rewrite the fate of a generation. One explanation <br> <br>: CCP \"We have two hands, out of town to eat the bread of idleness\" for the slogan, obviously unemployed urban labor force to the rural settle down as the solution to unemployment approach. Unemployment in the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, is a unique phenomenon of bourgeois society, socialist society, of course, there is no unemployment problem. Industry and agriculture in mainland China after the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution completely stagnant, grain output gradually insufficient to meet the needs of the growing urban population, the government can not work in arranging the fields of industry and services to the urban youth. More important, he launched the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong has reached the main purpose of cleared Liu Shaoqi and other opponents gradually become troublesome, difficult to control the Red Guards, a huge number of unemployed youth in the political stability of a high level of interest in politics pose a serious threat. A large number of urban youth sent to the countryside for agricultural labor, in addition to economic considerations, a divide-and-conquer political strategy. Mao Zedong government <br> interpretation of field sports: re-education by poor peasants in order to prevent the \"revisionist\" and young people \". Mao Zedong after the Chinese Communist government to avoid discussing this movement relates to the fate of tens of millions of people, nor any compensation to the victims. <br> <br> Some people think that the campaign of mockery and persecution of people. Is said to be against Mao&#39;s programmatic document drafted by Lin Biao and others, \"five hundred seventy-one engineering Minutes\" educated youth \"to the mountains and the countryside is a\" de facto Laogai. <br> movement over the past few decades later, when the educated youth who have become the main force of China&#39;s socio-political and economic, they usually stay in rural youth to be nostalgic, even someone claiming to be \"in the vast spent in the world of childhood and youth, this generation of people, there is a common feeling - never regret it. . \"<br> Deng Xiaoping once said: It took us thirty billion, bought three are not satisfied: educated youth are not satisfied, the parents are not satisfied, the farmers were also dissatisfied. <br> proved, young intellectuals mountains and the countryside is historical regression <br> the educated youth and the poor peasant eat memory bitter rice <br> farewell educated youth <br>'
