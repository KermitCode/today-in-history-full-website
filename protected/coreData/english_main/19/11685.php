'cont'=>'(Kang Xi winter of early one), December 19, 1979, Japanese scholars for the first time to determine the structure of cancer-causing genes. <br> in December 1979, (history TodayOnHistory.com) by the Institute of Chemistry, Kyoto University Professor Gao Langman and the University of Tokyo Institute of Medical Sciences, Sapporo Medical the large Cancer Institute researchers a research team, composed of the world for the first time to determine the cause of animal cells cancerous adenovirus type 12 \"cancer genes\" structure. <br> reported that this determination of cancer-causing genes, two thousand three hundred and twenty bases arranged in a certain order, which encoded the two specific proteins of unknown function. To prove that cancer is caused due to the role of these proteins, we can immediately find out the carcinogenic mechanism is still a mystery. <br> reported that adenovirus to cause cold symptoms without carcinogenic effects. However, it is injected into the big black rat cells to cause cancer, especially adenovirus type 12 are highly carcinogenic. The research team in order to take advantage of this virus to figure out the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, first allow the virus with a human monoclonal cell proliferation, and then extract the virus proliferation on the basis of its genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to finalize the structure. It has been reported that adenovirus type 12 DNA about 30,000 base pairs, while at the end of seven percent of carcinogenic effects. The research team determined that the carcinogenic effects of the portion of the structure. Microbial Diseases Institute of <br> Osaka University, for a long time really, Toshima male professor said, to determine adenovirus type 12 structure has great significance, especially the one hand, to confirm that part of carcinogenicity, determine its structure will become valuable information to study the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. <br>'
