'cont'=>'December 21, 1993 (πÔ”œ winter of early nine), American the information superhighway policies preliminary molding. <br> 1993 12 21, U.S. Vice President Al Gore said that the policy of the U.S. government about the \"information superhighway\" has taken shape, and soon will be submitted in the form of a draft law to Congress for discussion. <br> \"information superhighway\" This year one of the hottest topics in the United States. The so-called \"information superhighway\", refers to the proposed establishment of a through U.S. universities, research institutions, businesses and ordinary Americans families nationwide information network, which is based on the exchange of information for the purpose of infrastructure. The name of the information infrastructure, terminology and design are borrowed from the fifties of this century and the start of construction, to act as one of the pillars of economic development, transportation infrastructure - interstate highway network in the past few decades. <br> also belong to the infrastructure, the \"information superhighway\" as important as, and may even exceed the highway. The technical conditions for the establishment of the \"information superhighway\" has been basically mature, simply can adjust and test applications for commercialization. Data, text, sound, images, and television programs can be via telephone lines, cable conveying line or a wireless telephone network to send and receive. In the future \"information superhighway\" integration of existing computer networking services, telephone and cable TV function will become an extremely wide range of services such as education, health, entertainment, business, financial project carrier. The biggest difference is that with the existing one-way TV media, \"information superhighway\" will be two-way form of communication, information consumers to become active provider of information. <br> Clinton and Al Gore last year to the construction of a national information network. January this year, shortly after taking office, Clinton authorized the establishment of a \"special team\" of information infrastructure, led by the Minister of Commerce Ron Brown - Vice President Al Gore, Chairman of the President&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers, Laura - Tyson, as well as a number of economic legal, technical experts and representatives of the telecommunications industry. Following several months of careful preparation, the most recent period, the core members of the special team weekly meeting at the White House to discuss. the <br> Gore pointed out in his speech of 21, government policy to develop the \"information superhighway\" is based on five principles: <br> First, to encourage private enterprise to increase investment <br> Second promote and protect competition between private enterprise <br> Third, [l $ dj¶”.®≠r®¿] the public has access to service <br> its four, avoiding to appear in the information owner disparity between the rich and the poor. \" the phenomenon <br> Fifth, maintenance, technical design flexibility. <br> Gore stressed to adapt to the needs of the \"information superhighway\", creating an environment conducive to the realization of this ambitious planning, support for the Clinton administration to modify the Communications Act, enacted in 1934, the eventual total elimination administrative and legal restrictions imposed on cable TV, telephone, TV and satellite telecommunications industrial enterprises. Gore believes that the \"information superhighway\" will be completed in 10 to 15 years. the <br> What \"information highway\"? <br> plan completed in the next 10-15 years, the \"information superhighway\" is computer technology and communication technology development and integration of the product, it will form the information the main trunk of the era of information flow. The implementation of this plan will give Americans work, learning, shopping and lifestyle brought about \"revolutionary changes\". The official name of <br> \"information superhighway\" is the \"national information infrastructure\", abbreviation NII. With the transportation network of the United States be able to directly reach factories, schools, hospitals, recreational facilities, and similar to the case of almost all the families, \"information superhighway\" designer hopes to build the information network can also achieve the same level of penetration, so that the Americans were able to extremely easy to get information. the most powerful tool for information exchange <br> information age is the computer. With the massive popularity of the personal computer in the United States, the flow of information among the tens of millions of computers are mainly dependent on the transmission of binary data in the phone line. Although the U.S. telephone penetration is now up to about 93%. Channels for the exchange of information between computers still only equivalent when the car first appeared many \"horse trails\" for technical reasons, the speed, capacity, and efficiency can not be improved, and the path is not very smooth. In the future \"information superhighway\" will be a new addition to the existing \"thoroughfares\" thoroughfares. Data compression to speed thousands of times on the \"highway\" fast delivery. Shop for \"pavement\" optical fiber. Typical of an optical fiber cable, is less than 1.3 cm in diameter, which contains the 32 hair thickness of the glass fiber yarn. Existing technical conditions, an optical fiber capable of delivering about 5,000 TV channels of the image signal and 500,000 telephone voice signals, but the actual utilization of this capacity only one-thousandth. <br> in view of the huge potential of optical fibers, the \"information superhighway\" will not only become a data transmission medium, will transport TV, telephone, teaching, financial and other services, to become the United States began in the 1950s, large-scale The popularity of the phone after the most significant communications revolution. <br>'
