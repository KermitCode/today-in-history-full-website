'cont'=>'(Bingyin the first month, the ninth day), February 21, 1926, the Dutch physicist, the superconducting discoverer card late Lin Onnes&#39;s death. end of <br> card Colin Onnes (1853 to 1926) <br> Kamerlingh-Onnes, Heike <br> Dutch physicist. September 21, 1853, was born in Groningen, and died February 21, 1926. Doctorate from the University of Groningen in 1879. In 1882, he was appointed professor of experimental physics at the University of Leiden, and create a world-famous cryogenic Research Center - Leiden Laboratory (later renamed to commemorate his card late Lin Onnes Laboratory). He taught at the school to his retirement in 1923. The late Lin of Onnes In the field of low-temperature physics research, from 1877 liquefied gas (air). Successfully liquefied hydrogen in 1906, 1908 and further liquefied and was permanent gas helium. Since then, he turned to the study measuring metal resistance changes with temperature. He found that the mercury in the the 4.22 ~ 4.27K low temperature resistance completely disappear in 1911, went to find some other metals also have the above characteristics. He called this phenomenon as superconductivity. It opens a new field of low temperature physics. Later, he found that the critical current and critical magnetic field of superconductors. Because of the outstanding contribution made by low-temperature physics, Colin Onnes end card for the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics. <br>'
