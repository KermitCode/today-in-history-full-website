'cont'=>'In started April (Gengshen to), May 21, 1860, ECG machine inventor William Aiyintuofen born. <br> Aiyintuofen (1860 to 1927) Dutch physiologist. May 21, 1860 Born in Java, September 28, 1927 and died in Leiden. His father is in Java Military. Into the Utrecht University School of Medicine in 1879. Received his MD in 1885. The following year, he served as a professor at Leiden University Students of Science, became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences. work on the basis of the British physiologist AD Waller <br> 1895 began the study of the cardiac action current the improvement the de A Senwa&#39;s the mirror image galvanometer, design chord galvanometer, with a diameter of 0.002 mm silver-plated quartz fiber instead of moving coil and mirror record the heart of the current and heart sounds, and to overcome the shortcomings of the previous instrument. <br> 1903, he identified the standard unit of measure of the ECG, i.e. the hatched tracings recorded fluctuations 1 cm on the vertical axis, represents 1 millivolt potential difference to move 1 cm to 0.4 seconds in the abscissa. P, Q, R, S, T, lettered on the waves in the ECG, and the to select hands with the left foot placed electrode plate, composed of three kinds of standard leads (still in use).
