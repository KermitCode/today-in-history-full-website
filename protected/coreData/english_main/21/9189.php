Connected to the flesh and blood of the compatriots on both sides, the Taiwan compatriots disaster and suffering has struck a chord in the hearts of all Chinese people. We are willing to provide all possible assistance to alleviate the loss of earthquake disaster. <br> 10 20, the person in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, the State Seismological Bureau for Recently, some people in Taiwan have repeatedly distorted and cast aspersions on the mainland to support the actions and efforts of the Taiwan earthquake relief (L $ dj而.c身m) in accepted across the Taiwan Strait and the interview to reporters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the relevant facts, rumors and accusations were refuted. the <br> National Seismological Bureau spokesman Li Qiang Hua Jieshao mainland earthquakes community concerned about Taiwan \"9.21\" strong earthquake. He said that the result of the relationship, the mainland earthquake departments and experts of the \"9.21\" earthquake is of particular concern, expressed condolences sent a letter to the leaders and experts of the Taiwan earthquake research institutions on the morning of the earthquake, and said that stands ready organize experts to Taiwan to help carry out the work. However, this proposal has failed so far to get the consent of the Taiwan authorities. October 15, in view of the earthquake emergency rescue work has come to an end, the earthquake zone will face restoration and reconstruction of the Seismological Society of China deliberately sent a letter to the Taiwan experts expressed their willingness to invite experts from Taiwan to the mainland to work together to study the problem of post-disaster reconstruction. However, Taiwan letter, that is not prepared to send people to. <br> said Li Qiang, China, earthquake is the common enemy of mankind, China is an earthquake-prone country, the two sides will continue to face the serious threat of earthquakes. Earthquake Relief humanitarian and scientific and technological areas, the two sides earthquake experts do not want this \"pan-politicized\". Zhu Zushou, <br> Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that the Taiwan authorities accused mainland obstructed international rescue unfounded. Earthquake rescue operations of the international community has expressed gratitude to facilitate as much as possible, and plans to start international aid through the United Nations. According to the relevant provisions of the United Nations, only sovereign states have the right to request to start international relief. Out of respect for Taiwan, the ARATS attorney sent a letter to Taiwan&#39;s Straits Exchange Foundation, Taiwan consultation, but the SEF letter, said there is no need. In fact, the international community, civil rescue operations have been normal in Taiwan successfully carried out, a total of more than 20 countries, more than 30 rescue team of more than 700 officers took part in the rescue work. <br> As for the so-called hindered delaying the allegations of Russian rescue workers flying station, Zhu Zushou said, the fact that the Ministry of the Russian state of emergency by the Embassy in the Russian aircraft, after the application of China&#39;s airspace, the Foreign Ministry and relevant departments to immediately give approval in consultation and there is no so-called not allowed Russian aircraft flew over. China is completely dealt with in accordance with international practice. Taiwan has repeatedly hype this issue with ulterior motives. Actually nothing to do but in some areas of the rescue team arrived in Taiwan, Taiwan had to leave early. <br> start international relief is very beneficial to the people of Taiwan, the Taiwan authorities to shift the earthquake relief \"politicization\" of attempting to engage in the \"earthquake diplomacy\" as a \"sovereign state\", he said, Some international organizations linked to. Just who obstructed international relief operations, who is in the earthquake relief \"politicized\", we should see clearly. Zhang Huaijun \"9.21\" earthquake, <br> the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office contacts the Secretary, Jiang Zemin and other state leaders repeatedly expressed condolences to the mainland from all walks of life rapidly launch aid disaster relief operations. He said that so far, the mainland around to raise a total equivalent to 5 million yuan of relief supplies, received a donation of 30 million yuan, the Red Cross Society of China tomorrow, in turn export the third batch of relief funds of $ 500,000. Taiwan Alliance for the Reunification of such groups and some people in Taiwan, he said, are thanked concern and goodwill of the mainland. But some people in Taiwan are deliberately distorted. Taiwan authorities to Jiang Zemin and other leaders concerned about the low-key reaction, Lee Teng-hui made no mention of the care and assistance of the mainland, and also took the opportunity to peddle the \"two states\" fallacy. Taiwan authorities, disregarding the needs of compatriots, relief workers and supplies to Taiwan on the mainland to take shelved delaying attitude, some people also repeatedly distorted the facts, spread rumors, libelous actively support the practice of the earthquake in Taiwan on the mainland side, slander . (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> Zhanghuai Jun said, a strong earthquake in Taiwan, this is an opportunity to promote the development of cross-strait relations, Taiwan a few people have the opportunity to undermine cross-strait relations, it is regrettable. We advise those people with ulterior motives, strengthening earthquake relief forces, do not try to transfer the Taiwan compatriots authorities relief operations ineffective dissatisfaction. We also hope that the Taiwan authorities to do more useful things for disaster relief and reconstruction, relief workers and supplies as soon as possible to allow mainland to Taiwan, in order to close the feelings of the people on both sides. <br> <br> September 23, a man from the rubble to retrieve portrait of grandmother and a the Avalokitesvara <br> September 22, a mother holding daughter, distraught, her husband and children are still buried in the ruins.
