'cont'=>'February 21, 1978 (, Wu Wu fifteenth), Zhang thickness function theory up to the world level. <br> 1978 young mathematician Zhang thick functional theory study has the important achievements of the world level. He successfully found deficient values &#8203;&#8203;of entire functions or meromorphic functions, asymptotic value and Ru Liya direction of (a strange direction) the organic link between the three, to make this link a specific mathematical argument, indicating that the entire function or meromorphic functions reflect the objective laws. Asymptotic value theory, Zhang thickness function theory up to the world level \"target =\" _blank \"> Zhang thickness International for many years does not solve the four problems in one fell swoop answers. <br>'
