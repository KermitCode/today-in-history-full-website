In September 2007, Foxconn employee 21-year-old Liu Bing resign two hours after the sudden death. June <br> 2007 18 Foxconn, a the Hou surname worker hanged himself in the toilet. events Comments <br> Foxconn ten jump <br> Foxconn is the world&#39;s leading foundries, among the world top 500 enterprises. However, as we all know, the public awareness of this enterprise, but it is built on top of the notoriety of the \"sweatshop\". Media survey in the intensity of the work, overtime, salaries and benefits aspects, Foxconn is not the worst, therefore \"far from &#39;sweatshop&#39;\". But I think that the mere reality there are more black heart of the existence of the business, such an assertion is too reckless. Last year, Foxconn lost due to a the foundry phone sample, resulting in employees Sundan Yong suicide, the enterprise result of clever self-defense, only deepened the impression of people want their cold-blooded and humanity. While looking at the list of 10 this year falls employees (the morning of May 21, 2010 10 cases), the youngest only 18 years old, but 24-year-old anger I only think Foxconn is more like a concentration camp, Perhaps the name of the first of the \"death factory\" than \"sweatshop\" used in the body of the Foxconn more appropriate. <br> the suicide complex social phenomenon has never been caused due to a single factor. Sociologist Emile Durkheim: the suicide phenomenon occurs when contact between individuals and social groups or society as a whole to obstacles or produce divorced. Foxconn media spokesman in response to the outside world, the best for the lives of 420,000 gathered in the range of 3 square kilometers of its profit-making enterprises to justify trying to blame the primary responsibility for the death of the deceased and social workers working and living conditions evasive, words and deeds is contemptible. And especially people feel sick, some of the so-called psychological expert, actually get the whole community&#39;s suicide rate higher than Foxconn to justify for this private enterprise. <br> raking in profits, refused to face up to the situation and to improve the working and living conditions of the workers, but lost three of five \"dharma guru\" and \"psychological experts\" show, who claim to respect customs reform Win \"decompression\", apply scientific psychological intervention, in my opinion, is more like the pretense of performing fundamental evasive and obscure the substantive issues purely the forest for the trees trick. Does not know that Rome was not built in one cold day, not at these three legs tricks can be resolved? The duty to protect the interests of workers unions, the spate of deaths, low voice, high-profile show without leaving accident enterprises dancing plus rebuked, in particular, feel sorrow and despair. <br>'
