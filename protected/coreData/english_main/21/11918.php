'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'December 21, 1997 (Landmarks in the winter months 22), China to build Asia&#39;s largest transonic wind tunnel. <br> 1997 12 21, the national key projects, Asia&#39;s largest transonic wind tunnel built in China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center, ventilation and successfully commissioning. It indicates that China has a world-class high-speed wind tunnel the transonic aerodynamic research and test capabilities into the most advanced in the world. <br> large transonic wind tunnel is China&#39;s independent development of the aerospace industry, a large infrastructure projects, the central leadership of this project is very caring. New transonic wind tunnel built the main structure is 66 meters long, 33 meters wide cross section of the test section of 2.4 m ¡Á 2.4 m, the highest in Asia. Advanced wind tunnel overall performance, the contemporary latest technology, more realistic and reliable test results, the analog state closer to the real flight conditions, is a milestone in the study of engineering of aerospace vehicles aerodynamic. The transonic aerodynamic <br> is the most complex, one of the most difficult problems in the research and development of aerospace vehicles. Due to the high technical performance requirements of this wind tunnel construction difficult, only a few developed countries to master the technology for the design and manufacture of large transonic wind tunnel. China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center has built a low-speed wind tunnel, a transonic wind tunnels, supersonic wind tunnel, shock tunnel, low-density wind tunnel and other types of wind tunnel 42, forming a large-scale, full range of The wind tunnels groups.
