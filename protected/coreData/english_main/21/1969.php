'cont'=>'February 21, 1938 (the first month 22) Tiger years, the death of the father of modern solar observational astronomy Haier. the <br> astronomer George Ellery Hale <br> (Georage Ellery Hale ,1868-1938) the <br> own humanity since the sun had all kinds of various kind of myths and legends, but no way to know the true face of the sun. Until 1891, the United States has a special instruments of their own invention produced before successfully captured the first photos of the sun, the photo is the true face of the sun. This person called Haier. born in Chicago <br> Haier childhood smart, studious, broad interests, like thinking. Childhood like listening to adults speak about the myths and legends of the sun, and once he heard the father&#39;s friend said, with blackened glass cover around the barrel of the telescope to look at the sun is not glaring. He immediately observe the sun in this way, a spectacular sight in the telescope show the edges of his eyes: huge fireball lit up the sky fire, like the immense grasslands, magnificent and incomparable. This observation he had a great interest in the study of the sun. <br> 1886, Haier, 18 years old, was admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied physics. Learning period, he continued to explore new methods of observation and study of the sun. Once on the train, sitting next to a naive children with red transparent Tang Zhi stand in front, said: \"Look, Mom red, red uncle? \"Haier to take that Tang Zhi Look up and stand in front of this the phenomenon touched Haier inspiration, he thought: Why are the colors seen across the red cellophane red? That is because the red cellophane other shade filtered out, and only allow red light through. Sun light by the combustion of a variety of elements of the light emitted, can not use a device, other light was filtered to only allow a light through it? It is this inspiration, he made a special lens - filter through several experiments. On this basis, he invented the manufacture of new instruments to observe the sun, captured the first ever photos. <br> 1895, Haier founded astrophysics journal, his writings stellar evolution studies Observatory decade, \"New Star\", \"depth of the universe\". <br> Haier lifelong study the sun, was the first to build the world&#39;s largest refracting telescope, first discovered sunspot magnetic field around, this is the first discovered outside the magnetic field of the Earth, for the first time to organize the world&#39;s solar observation network, he later re held to build a major project - a 508 cm reflector telescope. February 21, 1938, Haier&#39;s death, people called him the \"Father of modern solar observatory astronomy. \"In order to commemorate the achievements of Haier, the combination of the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1969 and Mount Palomar Observatory, unified renamed the\" Haier Observatory. <br>'
