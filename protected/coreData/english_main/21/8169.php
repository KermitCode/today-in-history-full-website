'cont'=>'July 11 (Gengshen years), August 21, 1980, Deng Xiaoping evaluation of Mao Zedong&#39;s historical status. When The Fallaci <br> <br> Olin Ainuo interview with Deng Xiaoping <br> 21, 23 days, 1980, Comrade Deng Xiaoping met with Italian reporters the Olin Ainuo - Fallaci, Mao Zedong&#39;s historical position to do a re-evaluation. The following is the transcript: <br> Olin Aina - Fallaci: Tiananmen Square on the image of Chairman Mao, whether you want to retain forever go down? <br> Deng Xiaoping: you want to keep forever go down. Past Chairman Mao hanging like too much, everywhere, hanging is not a serious thing, and can not show that respect for Chairman Mao. Although Chairman Mao in the past have also made mistakes, but he is after all the main founders of the Communist Party of China, People&#39;s Republic of China. And take his power over the error, after all, is the second bit. The things he do for the Chinese people can not be ruled out. From the feelings of the Chinese people, we will never put him as the founder of our party and the country to commemorate. <br> Austria: For Westerners, we do not understand a lot of problems. Let&#39;s talk about the \"Gang of Four\", the Chinese people a lot of errors attributed to the \"Gang of Four\" history today www.lssdjt.com] said the \"Gang of Four\", but they extended it five fingers. <br> Deng: errors of Chairman Mao and Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\" nature of the problem is different. Chairman Mao lives most of the time is a very good thing to do, he repeatedly from the crisis in the party and the state to save over. Chairman Mao, at least we Chinese people but also a longer time in the dark. Chairman Mao&#39;s greatest achievements is the reality of the principles of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution, and pointed out that the road to win the victory of the revolution in China. Should be said that, in the sixties or late fifties, many of his ideas has brought us victory, he raised some fundamental principle is very correct. His creative Marxism-Leninism applied to all aspects of the Chinese revolution, including philosophy, politics, military, literary and other fields, have creative views. But, unfortunately, he late in life, especially in the \"Cultural Revolution\" made a mistake, and the error is not small, and our party, state and people to bring a lot of misfortune. You know, our party in the Yanan period, the Chairman Mao thought summed up as Mao Zedong Thought, as our party&#39;s guiding ideology. It is because we follow the Mao Zedong Thought, before the great victory of the revolution. Of course, Mao Zedong Thought is not a person of Comrade Mao Zedong creation, (Lssdjt.com), including the older generation of revolutionaries are involved in the establishment and development of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong thought. However, because of the victory, he is less cautious in his later years, some unhealthy factors, unhealthy thoughts gradually outcrop, the main idea of &#8203;&#8203;some of the \"left\". A considerable part contrary to his original thought, contrary to his original very good to the correct position, including his work style. At this time, he was exposed to less practical. He dies without a good style of the past, for example, democratic centralism, the mass line, good follow through, not developed nor the formation of a good system. This is not only the shortcomings of Comrade Mao Zedong himself, those of us older generation of revolutionaries, including me, is responsible. The political life of our Party, the country&#39;s political life is somewhat normal, patriarchal or paternalistic development, the glorification of the individual things more, the whole political life is not so healthy, and, eventually, lead to the \"Cultural Revolution\". \"Cultural Revolution\" is wrong. <br> Obama: You said that Chairman Mao in after a period of poor health, but Liu Shaoqi was sent to prison, and died in prison, Chairman Mao&#39;s body is not that bad. Past other errors, the Great Leap Forward Is not wrong? Copying the Soviet model it is not an error? Past this error to be traced back to when? Chairman Mao launched the Cultural Revolution \"in the end want to do? <br> Deng: The error from the late fifties. For example, the Great Leap Forward is incorrect. This responsibility is not just Chairman Mao, the brains of those of us who have fever. Completely contrary to the objective law, attempted once to boost the economy. The subjective desire contrary to the objective laws, will certainly be affected by the loss. Great Leap Forward, the main responsibility of Chairman Mao. Then, after a few months time, Chairman Mao First quickly found these errors is proposed to correct these errors. Due to other factors, this correction is not carried through. In 1962, Chairman Mao on these issues of self-criticism. But after all of these lessons summed insufficient, leading to the outbreak of the \"Cultural Revolution\". To engage in the \"Cultural Revolution\", Chairman Mao desire out of to avoid consideration of the restoration of capitalism, but made a wrong estimate of the actual situation in China itself. First, the object of the revolution made a mistake, leading to a grasp of the so-called \"within the party taking the capitalist road kleptocrats. This blow to the original revolution has done, the actual experience of leading cadres at all levels, including Comrade Liu Shaoqi, including. 2012 prior to his death, Chairman Mao said before, the Cultural Revolution, two errors, a \"Down with everything\", a \"comprehensive civil war. Only speak on these two points, we can not say the \"Cultural Revolution\" is correct. Chairman Mao committed a political error, and this error is not small. Other hand, the use of two counterrevolutionary groups of Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\" error. Their aim is a conspiracy to seize power. Therefore, to distinguish between the errors of Chairman Mao Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\" crimes. <br> Austria: But we all know, is Chairman Mao chose Lin Biao, like the king of the West choose as heir, Lin Biao. <br> Deng: This is what I have just said is not the correct approach. A leader of their choice to their successors, follows a feudalism. I just say that our system is not perfect, including the inner. the Olin Aina Fallaci <br> picture <br>'
