'cont'=>'March 21, 1887 (Chinese New Year on February 27), electromagnetic waves by Hertz confirmed the presence marks a new era of the radio communication. In 1887, German physicist Hz (hertz) experiments confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves, resulting in the birth of the radio, and open up a new era of electronic technology, which marks from cable communication \"to\" radio communication \"turning point. <br> 1887, Hertz send Helmholtz article entitled \"On the insulator in electrical process caused induction papers, summed up this important discovery. Then, Hertz also confirmed by experiments of the electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave, having a similar characteristic with the light, such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and the experiment of two electromagnetic interference, also confirmed that propagate in a straight line, the electromagnetic wave propagation velocity and the velocity of light the same, in order to fully verify the correctness of Maxwell&#39;s electromagnetic theory. And further improve the Maxwell equations, to make it more beautiful, symmetrical, come to the modern form of the Maxwell equations. In addition, Hertz has made a series of experiments. He studied ultraviolet spark discharge, the discovery of the photoelectric effect, that is, in the light irradiation object will release the electronic phenomenon. The discovery later became Einstein to establish the basis of the quantum theory of light. German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (February 22, 1857 - 1894, January 1), <br> first confirmed the existence of radio waves in 1888. And the great contribution of electromagnetism, so the frequency of the International System of Units unit Hertz is named after him. (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) <br> early boyhood on the optical and mechanical experiments attracted. 19-year-old into the Dresden Institute of Technology to study engineering, and love of the natural sciences, and the following year transferred to the University of Berlin, a professor of physics at the Helmholtz under the guidance of learning. In 1885, he was appointed professor of physics at the University of Karl Karlsruhe. 1889, to succeed the Clausius served as a professor of physics at the University of Bonn, until his death. <br> Hertz greatest contribution to human experiments confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves. <br>'
