'cont'=>'February 21, 2008 (the fifteenth day of Lunar New Year), the U.S. fired missiles successfully intercepted the runaway satellite. In In morning of May 21, 2008, the Pentagon said the message in the Pacific Ocean, west of Hawaii, the U.S. emission standard 3 missile, successfully intercepted the out-of-control spy satellite USA193. This is the first real use of its missile defense system, launch sea-based missiles to shoot down the satellite. <br> Fengyun cost $ 1 billion, \"USA193\" satellite was launched in 2006, and soon lost control. Is expected to be the first week of March through the atmosphere, falling earth. 2 tons monster carrying 455 kilograms of toxic fuel hydrazine, will not burn out after re-entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the some wreckage scattered to the radius of the size of two football fields on the ground, and the smoke emissions of toxic fuel is likely to cause died. (History today www.lssdjt.com) <br> Russian Defense Ministry that the United States is to protect human health as an excuse to test its new Strategic Arms. <br> early in the Cold War era, the United States began the pursuit of anti-satellite capabilities, and several anti-satellite test; October 1962, the United States hit satellite carrying a nuclear warhead intercontinental missile test, the calculations are not careful, the target star did not hit, so anti-damage to three satellites; since the 70s of the last century, the United States began to focus on the kinetic and directed anti-satellite weapons. In 1985, an F-15 fighter fired missiles at an altitude of 80,000 feet, crashing into the running a low-orbit satellite. Since then, the United States and then not carried out the missile hit the satellite test; Currently, the U.S. focus on the development of directed-energy anti-satellite weapons. More mature directed energy weapons laser weapons. In October 1997, the United States, a test center in southern New Mexico desert, the use of laser weapons to launch two high-energy laser beam to the weather satellites in orbit, the satellite is not working properly, that the United States already has the use of lasers to destroy orbiting satellite capacity. <br>'
