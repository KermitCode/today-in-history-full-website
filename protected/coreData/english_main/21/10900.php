'cont'=>'November 21, 2009 (Year of the OX October fifth day), the best annual biological photomicrographs, Daphnia microscopic according to top. 2009,, <br> 2009 11 21, the best biological photomicrograph: Cyclops microscopic according to topped <br> According to foreign media reports, in 2009, Olympus biological digital photomicrography contest (Olympus BioScapes) Results were announced. Works from Germany the Daphnia \"win show Daphnia part of the internal organization and the exoskeleton structure. the following as the contest <br> top ten winning entries: <br> 1 the Daphnia <br> <br> Daphnia <br> Daphnia like a comb tiara (head position the green spikes like structure), to see them, predator will no appetite. Spiked tiara is about 200 microns in diameter, appeared in the experience horseshoe crab insect release chemical signals Daphnia offspring. Jim Michels (Jan Michels), University of Kiel, Germany, to produce this photo using a confocal laser scanning microscopy. The work won the first prize in the 2009 Olympus biological digital photomicrography contest. Exoskeleton green fluorescent bleaching dye and Daphnia some internal tissue (including into a blue and red of the fly&#39;s eye), the fluorescence generated from the scene of the such a luster Lu exposed to the laser light microscope. (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> 2. Synaptonemal complex <br> <br>-synaptonemal complex <br> corncob in this Zhang Zheng undergo meiosis (cell division one) close-up of the plant cell nucleus. Rachel King (Rachel Wang) of the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. use of three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, high-definition images produced some fragments of the synaptonemal complex (synaptonemal complex): two protein chains are arranged in parallel, at intervals of not to 200 nm, to provide structural support for chromosomes during meiosis. This new technology reveals 10 such anomalous helical structure, technical personnel using digital means for each colorant, so that they will separate one. <br> 3. the algae,&#39;s sexual activities <br> <br> algae the sexual activity <br> of <br> this the famous tiny objects is used in all textbooks sexual activity, show low organisms. This suggests that even the simple structure of the algae, the same also sexually attractive. \"Male\" cells look through the tiny fertilized tube looks like an amoeba. \"Female\" cells (gametes) have been formed between them. Cytoplasm filled with vacuoles, the vacuole is getting bigger and bigger, the release of the water-containing material from the gametes, so the protoplasts shrink into a compact resting spores two sinks together. Mature diploid cells can withstand long, severe stress (such as drought), and then go through meiosis, into a new generation. This image is completed by Jeremy Pickett - He Pusi (Jeremy Pickett-Heaps) production. (Lsjt.net) <br> 4. The algae <br> <br> algae <br> quality algae show ordered internal apparent natural red pigment - - astaxanthin. The algae are each about 40 microns in diameter single cells. Generated by such algal cells astaxanthin is used to produce the orange-red color. Issaquah, Washington, USA, a professional photographer Charles Klein Booth (Charles Krebs) use of phase contrast microscopy to capture photos of the algae samples taken from the outdoor pond. <br> 5. cylindrical drum the algae <br> <br> cylindrical drum algae <br> David Dermot Chomsky (David Domozych) The first microtubule poisons treatment, followed by the single-celled the cylindrical drum algae (Penium) antibody JIM5 marked out. the death of the Aequorea jellyfish tentacles <br> <br> Aequorea jellyfish tentacles <br> Aequorea jellyfish&#39;s tentacles look like delicate <br> 6. red ribbons, and the ribbons of beads (each with a diameter of about 300 microns) was full of toxins to encounter prey or inadvertent contact with humans, the toxins will be released. University of Sao Paulo, Brazil Ayr of Alvaro Mi Getuo (Alvaro E. Migotto), in the vicinity of the creek from the Marine Biology Research Center of the University of Aequorea jellyfish found this photo, and then immediately photographed with a microscope. In this figure, the Aequorea jellyfish tentacles the flexible muscles beam looks like a squiggly white line. <br> 7. the zebrafish larval axons <br> <br> zebrafish larvae axons <br> covering three days old zebrafish larvae tail sensory axons. Albert Pan (Albert Pan) with red, cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins will be the axon marked out. <br> 8. Arabidopsis flower <br> <br> Arabidopsis flower <br> Heidi Purvis (Heiti Paves) with Microscopy making the Arabidopsis flower photos. <br> 9. salmon fish larvae <br> <br> salmon larvae <br> salmon embryos survived very long time and eventually let the woman Mount Holyoke College students Ha Luka ¡¤ Fuji Makkedah (Haruka Fujimaki) took this photo. As a part of western Massachusetts, the Atlantic salmon recovery plan, Fuji Makkedah reared salmon. One day, her bright-field optical technology to capture photos of Atlantic salmon larvae. Just three larvae hatch, together with the yolk sac to absorb nutrients. Their eyes diameter of about 2 mm. <br> 10. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients skin cells <br> <br> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients skin cells <br> after special processing, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the patient&#39;s skin cells into stem cells, stem cells then differentiate into motor neurons that cause this disease cells. Columbia University Gist Croft and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis medical schemes Ma Kenzi Wiley Gantt (Mackenzie Weygandt) use reverse fluorescence microscopy photographed the motor neurons and 25 microns wide nuclei (green) and its long connection axon fibers (i.e., red) so that with the healthy cells to the same diseased cells for comparison. the <br> Comments: 2009 best biological photomicrograph gives a brilliant color ~ <br> of'
