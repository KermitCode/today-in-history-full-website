'cont'=>'(Rat May eighth day), June 26, 1936, the the the normal manipulation helicopter in the world&#39;s first aircraft a successful maiden flight in Germany. <br> 1936 26, the German Fokker earlier helicopters from various improvements, public display of his own manufacture FW-61 helicopter, one year after the aircraft to create a number of world records. This is a body similar to the fixed-wing aircraft, but not a large fixed-wing and rotor row helicopters, two rotor with two sets of thick metal frame to the top right and top left of the support from the two rotor level installed in the top of the bracket. The plane shape of the blade is taper, waving hinge and shimmy hinge connected to the hub. Automatic tilt allows the rotor rotation plane tilt vertical manipulation tilted in different directions by two rotor yaw manipulation. Total rotor blade pitch is fixed by changing the rotor speed to change the rotor Rally. The rudder and horizontal stabilizer to increase stability. FW61 rotor hub mounted on the cyclic pitch means, may be changed in the rotor during rotation of the blade pitch. There is a variable pitch of the joystick to change the inclination of the rotor surface, to achieve the direction of flight control. FW61 is set cycle pitch devices and joysticks to ensure its maneuvers. The aircraft rotor diameter of 7 meters. The power plant is a power of 140 hp piston engine. This is the world&#39;s first a normal-operated helicopter. The aircraft 100 to 120 kilometers per hour, a range of 200 km, a takeoff weight of 953 kg. <br> 1938, a young German girl Hannalaiqi driving one pair of rotor helicopters were a perfect flight demonstration at the Berlin Stadium. This helicopter helicopter sector is considered to be the world&#39;s first successful test flight of a helicopter. <br> Comments: This is a human initiative, when disasters strike, (TodayinHistory.cn) can save a lot of people! <br> Comments: great progress of human civilization.
