'cont'=>'(Bingyin March 18), April 26, 1986, the Soviet Union, the Chernobyl nuclear accident occurred. the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident <br> bird&#39;s eye view of <br> 1986 April 26, 2010, the world&#39;s worst nuclear accident occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union. 130 km north of Kiev, Ukraine, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophic fires caused by leakage of radioactive material, contaminated most of Europe, the international community has widely criticized the Soviet blockade of the nuclear accident news and emergency response slow. High levels of radioactive substances in Sweden found that the accident was only exposed to the world. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is the largest nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union, a total of four units. April, down to check the planned unit 4, the power station staff repeatedly mishandling reactor energy increases. In the early morning of the 26th, the reactors melting combustion, explosion, breaking the protective shell fire plant, radioactive material stream escape. Extinguishing water and chemical agents, the moment is evaporated, the fireman&#39;s boots trap did in the melting asphalt. Units 1, 2 and 3 to suspend operation of 30 km around the plant declared a danger zone and evacuate residents. The death of two people on the spot when the accident occurred, was the radiation injured 204 people. May 8, the reactor stopped burning, the temperature still reached 300 ¡ã C; local radiation intensity up to 15 milliroentgen per hour, Kiev City 0.2 milliroentgen normal allowable amount is 0.01 milliroentgen. Sweden detected radioactive dust, and 100 times more than the normal number. Western countries rushed withdrawal of expatriates and tourists from the Kiev region, refused to accept the imported food in Belarus and Ukraine. Former Soviet Union officially announced four months later, a total of 31 people died, mainly rescue workers, including a major general; 203 people have radiation sickness; 135,000 withdrawal from the danger zone. In 1992, the Ukrainian official announcement, there are more than 7,000 were killed in the accident nuclear contamination. <br> 5, Blix, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be invited by the Soviet government, back to the case of nuclear power plants by helicopter from a height of 800 meters, he thinks this is by far the world&#39;s most serious nuclear accident. being <br> disaster two years, 26 people took part in the handling of the accident, poured a layer of concrete, as the \"coffin\" bury the No. 4 reactor. The cleaned 21 million m2 Zangtu \"to build a nuclear power plant workers the Ë¹À­ÎÚ½ÝÆæ Metro, the construction of 21,000 homes for the residents to evacuate. All this, including power generation to reduce losses, a total of 80 billion rubles (about U.S. $ 12 billion). The Ukrainian government has made the decision to permanently close the power station. <br> the Republic of Belarus has lost 20% of the agricultural land, 2.2 million people live in the land was contaminated, into one hundred towns and villages to an empty house. Ukraine abandoned the restricted area became a the thieves park and Mustang paradise, all valuables were stolen, so the spread of contamination to the area outside. Near the nuclear power plant within seven kilometers of pine, spruce wilting, the gradual death of 1,000 hectares of forest. 30 km away from the \"security zone\" is not safe, cancer patients, children with thyroid patients and morbid livestock increased dramatically; even if the collective farm 80 kilometers away, 20% of the piglets born also found that the eye is not normal. The above strange disease are referred to as \"Chernobyl syndrome\". <br> land, water is seriously polluted, thousands of people were forced to leave their homes. Chernobyl has become a desolate barren. After 10 years, the radioactivity continues threatened by approximately 800 million people in the life and health of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Experts say the consequences of the Chernobyl accident will continue for centuries.
