'cont'=>'September 26, 2006, the fifth day of August (BingXu years), nuclear non-proliferation efforts suffered a major setback. the <br> 2006 (the L $ dj而.c身m) Iran nuclear issue dispute finally broke through the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test. These two events suggest that the international nonproliferation efforts suffered a major setback. In In November 14, the press conference held in the capital, Tehran, Iranian President Ahmadinejad - speech. He said that Iran will continue to advance its nuclear program, and will eventually install 60,000 centrifuges used for uranium enrichment. In the past year, the progress made by Iran in nuclear technology shock the International Atomic Energy Agency, although this progress away from the United States are worried about the \"level\" of nuclear weapons, there is a great distance. The purity of the enriched uranium in Iran at least 5% of the industrial-grade level. Uranium of lower purity can be used as the fuel of the nuclear power plant, if the purity is above 90%, uranium can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. Iran earlier this year announced before the end of the year the centrifuge the number increased to 3,000 units, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - Ahmadinejad is Iran will eventually install 60,000 centrifuges. The news shocked the world the <br> Korean Central News Agency announced on October 9, 2006 North Korea successfully conducted an underground nuclear test that day. Although the international community on the North Korean nuclear test data vary, but the fact that the North Korean nuclear test is accurate. This shows that North Korea already has the technology and capacity to produce nuclear weapons, despite its technical how high, how much capacity is still a mystery. <br> In addition, the international nuclear disarmament process stalled, delays in force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. the <br> Western countries of double standards, \"the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" the authority and effectiveness questioned by non-nuclear countries. (1 $ dj而.c身m) the United States in March this year and refused to sign the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \", India signed a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. The boycott of the United States and other Western countries, the 50th Session of the IAEA General Conference held in September this year, often will not vote on the Arab countries jointly submitted a resolution about Israel&#39;s nuclear capabilities and threat \". <br> Currently, in addition to the country has nuclear weapons, nuclear technology around the world there are about 30 countries have reached a high level. Once these countries out of the international non-proliferation regime will be able to have the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons in the short term. At the same time, international terrorists through the underground smuggling channels access to sensitive nuclear technology and high-purity nuclear materials, increasing the risk of a nuclear terrorist attack. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to prevent illicit trafficking database \"data show that global smuggling, theft, illegal possession, transportation and trading of nuclear materials from over 100 events annually, including cross-border smuggling of nuclear activities were also significantly increased in the past three years, . <br>'
