'cont'=>'June 26, 2000 (Gengchen May 25), the working draft of human genome debut. <br> 2000 26, the working draft of the human genome has been drawn to the whole world after the. Contact <br> Human Genome Project, the international organization, the Institute of Genetics, Professor Yang Huanming human genome genetic code deciphered, which makes clear the human understanding has entered a new phase. <br> It is reported that the quality and quantity of the \"working draft\" far exceeded expectations, not only cover 97% of the genome, and 85% of the genome sequence has been assembled. This provides information for the study of human genetic material polymorphism. <br> worth mentioning is nearing completion more than 50% of the sequence diagram standard the complete diagram standard 20% of the sequence has been reached, there are thousands of genes were identified dozens of genes that cause is positioned. The scientists believe that this laid the foundation for all sequencing work is to be completed by June 2001. (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> human genome contains about 60,000 to 100,000 genes, by about 3 billion base pairs, distributed in 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus. To decipher the hidden mysteries of life, decided the \"bible\" of human sickness and death, 1990, known as the life-moon program \"International Human Genome Project started, mainly by the United States, Japan, Germany, France, scientists from Britain and other countries participate. In September 1999, China actively join the research program, is responsible for 1% of the determination of the entire sequence of the human genome on chromosome 3 is 30 million base pairs, China has therefore become involved in this research program the only developing country. Since then, under the support of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing and Shanghai, scientists jointly sponsored sprint to the peak of the life sciences. In just six months, the Chinese scientists on the basic completion of the Human Genome Sequencing tasks assumed to decipher the human chromosome 3, part of the genetic code, which indicates that China has made its own contribution to the international Human Genome Research also proves our The scientists have the ability to play an active role in a major international cooperation. <br> decipher the human genetic code is considered not only the most important events in biology since Darwin, is also considered to be the most important scientific research projects in the history of mankind. After envisaged base sequencing, scientists will analyze the base composition of the gene as well as a variety of gene function. To ascertain the location, structure and function of all genes, will pave the way for human conquest of a variety of difficult illnesses. <br> It is reported that the working draft, 60% of the sequence is determined in the last six months. During this time, our scientists and international counterparts per second determination of the 1000 base, seven days a week, 24 hours a day to work hard to draw the blueprint of human life. decipher the human genetic code <br> \"Human Genome Project\" basic data, have been free of charge for the use of researchers around the world. <br>'
