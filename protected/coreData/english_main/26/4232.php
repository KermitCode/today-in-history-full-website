'cont'=>'(, Xin Mao on March 24), April 26, 2011 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, \"ghost town\". the 25th anniversary of the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident after the <br> \"target =\" _blank \"> Chernobyl nuclear power plant a bird&#39;s eye view <br> April 1986 26 am, in the Soviet Ukraine to join a fierce explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, 130 kilometers north of the capital of the Republic of Kiev, the the reactor engine room building was destroyed, and at the same time there was a fire, a large number of leaks of radioactive substances within the reactor, the surrounding environment is seriously contaminated, resulting in a nuclear power in the history of the most serious accident. (history com) <br> the Chernobyl nuclear power plant a total of four power are one million kilowatts of nuclear reactors, its power generation accounts for 50% of Ukraine&#39;s total generating capacity, provide most of the Eastern European countries with an important power. reactor of the nuclear power plant is the 1970s, the introduction of water-cooled graphite-moderated reactors, uranium fuel rods on a bunch of graphite from graphite to effectively control the speed of the reaction, which to generate to promote steam turbines. graphite reactor is not safe enough, many years ago by the Western countries abandoned such a reactor cooling system failure, the core graphite rod temperature would spike until it exceeds the melting point and lead to meltdown accident April 25, 1986, the staff of the No. 4 reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant mishandling continuous cut off the power of the reactor, the main cooling system stops working, so the core temperature increased rapidly, resulting in hydrogen is too thick , as well as violent explosions occurred in the early morning of the 26th, the explosion caused by engine room fire, smoke makes breathing difficult, radioactive substances constantly spillover. nuclear power plant area with 25,000 residents, these residents evacuation shared 34 hours from the morning of the 26th. <br> nuclear power plant accident, a large number of radiation dust pollution to some countries in Northern Europe, Eastern and Western Europe, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the European Community lodged a strong protest to the Soviet Union on April 29. Swedish National Institute of Radiology, the spokesman said, which incident after falling to the content of radioactive substances in the eastern coastal areas of Sweden has more than the normal standard of 100 times. Fowles Mark nuclear power plant in the north of Sweden around 10 kilometers within found radiology dust increased, 600 workers were forced to evacuate the nuclear power plant, nearly residents of a long line waiting to accept the inspection of radioactive dust. Danish Prime Minister Shi Lvte strongly condemned the Soviet Union failed to immediately alert its neighbors on nuclear plant accident. the heaviest contamination Poland, the Polish government has established a special by The committee led by the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for dealing with this accident hazards, and to take measures to prevent the nuclear power plant overflow radioactive dust harm the health of the Polish instruct people not to consume the milk produced by cows fed green fodder, 18-year-old to the area concerned following residents issuing potassium iodide. Yugoslav government also asked residents do not take advantage of the rain, not to drink the grazing of sheep and cattle in the wild milk, do not eat raw fresh vegetables after <br> the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in more than five months recovery power generation, the Soviet Union suffered huge losses. According to the Soviet Union, the official, the accident caused direct economic losses of 20 billion rubles (about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars), if the loss of the Soviet Union, tourism, foreign trade and agriculture together could reach hundreds of billions of dollars at the same time, the hazards of the nuclear accident, 33 people were killed and more than 300 severely radiation has been sent to the hospital, more people are subject to varying degrees of radiation contamination in order to prevent further the radiation, the Soviet Union more than 280,000 people to evacuate to the outside the radiation zone. <br> at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near the town of Pripyat, a ghost town, a wall decorated with graffiti in 1986 April 26, Ukraine&#39;s Chernobyl nuclear power plant on the 4th unit exploded, causing the most serious in the history of nuclear accidents, forcing thousands of people to flee, causing long-term health, agriculture, and economic disaster. nearby Pripyat quarter of the town has been abandoned, nuclear radiation pollution and make it into the danger zone from the nuclear accident in <br> 2011 4 26 is the 25th anniversary of the nuclear power plant and its surrounding towns remains a disaster when the scene, like a seat of a ghost town, where time seems to have been stationary. figure still save the things that happened from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the nearest town of Pripyat, an abandoned building. disaster thousands of lives threatened, forest and farmland have been contaminated. explosive release of nuclear radiation released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in the United States and 400 times the amount of radiation. <br> standing Pripyat Town, one on the top floor of the hotel to the distance to see the town had for the convenience of the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant construction. now, scientists are still arguing in the end how many people died in the nuclear pollution incidents. town a playground, Pripyat, <br>, full of rusty dust of bumper cars. located in the town of Chernobyl 30 km away, has been empty since the nuclear accident one nuclear accident, the former Soviet Union, officials did not immediately inform the disaster did not know, even the residents of the town of Pripyat weeds the <br> corner of the town of Pripyat can see live life despite the government issued an official warning, but there are still hundreds of local residents to return here. quarter of the town of Lenin, <br> Pripyat, an abandoned street furniture store large area of &#8203;&#8203;the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion radioactive cloud spread to many parts of Europe, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes and the World Health Organization said last week that there were 60 million people exposed to high radiation contamination, 4,000 people died of cancer. backflow the (lsjt.net The) <br> time: a school canteen in the town of Pripyat, the cash register has been severe corrosion. <br> abandoned apartment building: the weather-beaten 16-story apartment on the roof, as well as the former Soviet coat of arms, seems to have been decades uninhabited of. <br> forever commemorate: in front of an abandoned nuclear power plant , there is a monument of the victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. <br> aerial historical picture: after the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, nuclear power plants over the aerial images.
