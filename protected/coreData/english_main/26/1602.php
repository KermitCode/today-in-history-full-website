'title'=>'The formal completion of the National Superconducting Laboratory in the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences',
'class'=>0,
'cont'=>'February 26, 1991 (Xinwei month 12) in the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Superconducting Laboratory officially completed. <br> to adapt to the rapid development of high-temperature superconductivity research, the State Planning Commission in 1987 approved the establishment of the National Laboratory for Superconductivity in the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Superconductivity Laboratory, started in 1988, completed on February 26, 1991, and formally opened to the public through the acceptance. First assessment in 1995, was a good class first. 2000 Second Assessment, State Key Laboratory was named the outstanding class. In January 2002, by the Ministry of Personnel, the Chinese Academy of Sciences as \"advanced collectives\". The current laboratory director by the smell the sea tiger researcher who temporal academicians as director of the Academic Committee. <br> superconducting laboratory research direction: superconductor exploration and study of new materials, new synthetic technology, high-temperature superconductors physical properties related to high-temperature superconductivity mechanism of experimental and theoretical studies, high temperature superconducting thin films and study of the physics of the device, and at the same time to carry out, and other related materials, the physical problem interdisciplinary research, to solve key technical problems in superconducting applications, to promote the superconducting technology transfer to the industrial sector. <br>'
