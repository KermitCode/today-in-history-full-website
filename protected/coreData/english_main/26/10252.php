'cont'=>'October 26, 1889 (Year of the OX October third), geologist Li Siguang the birth. Li Siguang, <br> formerly known as Li Zhongkui <br> in 1889 10, 26, Siguang was born in a poor family in rural Hubei Huanggang County. He studious, the age of 13 admitted to the provincial capital Wuchang colleges with honors, but he did not expect to learn of Geology. When he left his home to go to school boat to Wuchang saw imperialist rampage warship in the Yangtze River, the big waves stirred up a small wooden boat overturned, very angry, swear to learn shipbuilding, creating a large warship, the foreigners expelled from Yangtze River, out of China! Later, he really excellent academic walked to go to Japan to learn the shipbuilding industry. However, shipbuilding steel, iron and steel, but also ore as raw material, so Siguang and traveled across oceans to the United Kingdom admitted to the University of Birmingham, pre-scientific mining. Two years of studying, he consider to shipbuilding, made the machine needs to iron ore, fuel, iron ore and fuel are all buried in the ground. China&#39;s vast land, mineral resources must be very rich. Therefore, it is first important to find iron ore, coal, oil, and to master key to open the underground treasure house, you have to learn the geology, he entered the Department of Geology study geology, but also and learn the curriculum of the Department of Physics. During this period, he received a bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s degree. &#39;s <br> 20, Siguang as a professor in the Department of Geology, Peking University. Doctor of Science degree at the University of Birmingham. After the liberation, Siguang of China&#39;s energy, earthquakes, mineral resources have raised important guidance to promote our geological work carried out. He is also very well versed in paleontology, Quaternary glacial geology and geomechanics. Siguang another major contribution is to break down the &#39;lean&#39; error thesis, found a large oil field for the Chinese people. <br> a long time, Chinese and foreign geologists always agreed that the lean, this is because the strata in the world has the largest oil field discovered in the hundreds of millions of years ago, most of the ocean formed, so that marine strata have oil generation conditions. China strata in the hundreds of millions of years ago, most of the land, so to conclude that China is a country lean. Siguang do not agree with this point of view, whether marine strata or continental strata, over a long period of research and study, with the geological structure of the oil generation conditions and oil storage, will be able to find a large oil field. Been discovered in his study and research of the Daqing Oilfield and Dagang Oilfield, Shengli Oilfield, Huabei Oilfield. Siguang made and made great contributions to China&#39;s geology. <br> Siguang and Zhou Enlai conversation <br>'
