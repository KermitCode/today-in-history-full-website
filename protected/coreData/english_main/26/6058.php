'cont'=>'June 26, 1945 (, Yiyou May 17), the Soviet Union under Stalin was the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. <br> <br> Joseph Vissarion Ivanovich Comrade Stalin (§ª§à§ã§Ú§æ.§£.§³§ä§Ñ§Ý§Ú§ß), March 5 (in 1879 12 21 ©¤ 1953 day), a great proletarian revolutionary international communist movement leader, one of the founder of the Soviet Union&#39;s most important. The supreme leader of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the commander of the Soviet Red Army. Stalin Comrade Georgians. Original surname Zhu Gash Willy. His comrades of Lenin, has made an indelible contribution to the victory of the October Revolution and the consolidation of the Soviet regime. From a historical point of view, the contribution of Comrade Stalin is huge. First, he inherited Lenin&#39;s behest, created the Soviet Union. He led the Soviet people in the establishment of the socialist system, the completion of the socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of the Soviet Union to become the first in Europe for more than a decade, the second in the world, a great socialist power. Third, he led the Soviet people won the great victory of the Great Patriotic War. Made outstanding contributions to the victory of the anti-fascist war. IV Stalin in accordance with the concept of Marxism-Leninism, established the world&#39;s first socialist model - Soviet-style socialism, this model is a far-reaching impact material. Overall, Comrade Stalin has made outstanding contributions to the development of peace and progress in the world. Stalin period, the Soviet Union accelerated development, greatly enhance the strength of the national economy, the socialist planned economy and the people&#39;s welfare system was established to protect the vast majority of fairness, justice. Stalin era, the eradication of the system of exploitation of man by man, the eradication of gambling, prostitution, drug abuse, gangs and other evils. Stalin era, the Soviet Union is a thriving, flourishing, and a promotion of new ideas and new ethics of communism, the fundamental equality of the new socialist society. <br> Comrade Stalin committed a serious error. Stalin&#39;s error lies in of: <br> first, the autocratic dictatorial, patriarchal serious. 21 years later, Stalin no longer modest and prudent, more and listen to criticisms and suggestions. Clear the opposition within the party, a large number of administrative and powerful means. Soviet Constitution of 1936 is one of furnishings posters, democracy and the rule of law is not implemented. <br> second, the cult of the individual. He founded a new Soviet-style privileges, create a bureaucratic hierarchical society, created new inequalities. <br> for small, weak country to pursue a big-nation chauvinism. To establish Eastern Front during World War II, Nazi Germany, (lssdjt.cn) signed a neutrality treaty with Japan. Big, not worth the candle. A compromise fascist forces is more rampant, two severely damaged the reputation of the socialist Soviet; the three damage the relationship between the Soviet Union and the surrounding small country. The Soviet Union in the years 1939-1941, wantonly infringing upon the rights of the territory of the small countries of Eastern Europe. And pay at the Yalta Conference with Churchill, Roosevelt vigorously foreign, showed the arrogance of the great-power chauvinism, snatched Outer Mongolia, serious damage to China&#39;s sovereignty. The end of World War II, to China can not be treated equally, like old Czar as maintenance of privilege in Northeast China. <br> fourth, after the war, the fraternal countries violently imposing the Soviet model, resulting in the long-term risk of the development of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, but also a very good head open later for the Soviet hegemonism. <br> fifth, Stalin in domestic policy, is too harsh. Thirties large revolutionaries, revolutionaries some enemies, but the killing of many innocent people, and cause irreparable damage. <br> Stalin alive propaganda media pull infinitely great, after the death of the domestic and foreign enemies slandered extremely despicable, hateful. Both are extreme, irrational. The the glorious greatness error of Comrade Stalin&#39;s at, we need to know. <br> Comments: Su&#39;s life, merits and demerits very, heroes can also be termed, or hardly operators. <br>'
