'cont'=>'August 26, 1905 (, Otomi July 26), the Polish mathematician and cryptologist Marian Reyes Minkowski was born. <br> Marian Reyes, Minkowski (Marian Rejewski) (1905 - 1980 February 13, 2011) is a Polish mathematician and of cryptographers. <br> Ray Aliyev Chomsky was born in the north-central Poland Bydgoszcz He was a graduate of the University of Poznan, and members of Poland&#39;s military intelligence agency he had statistically as advanced students learning at the University of Goettingen, Germany, after returning to join Poland the Military Intelligence password at (Biuro Szyfrow). after a very short period of time, he requires analysis of the German military had just put into use the new password system - Enigma carrying out this work during his fundamental development the cryptanalysis. before cryptanalysis methods in natural language model and the statistical properties, such as letter frequency analysis. Minkowski Reyes, however, the first time in his attack on the Enigma cipher application of pure mathematics. Not only did he deduce the Nazi Wehrmacht Enigma rotor wiring (and its closest commercial Enigma variants - D-different), and also gives a feasible method to decipher this password and thrown Poznan University Graduate Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski and password at the staff with the assistance of same password at work, in the early 1930s, (L $ dj而.c身m) he designed and manufactured the IDF Enigma available reproductions. <br> Enigma <br> The team also designed a machine to help cryptanalysis work. initially called \"Hutchison turn\", then \"Bomba\" (more or less is a multiple of the Enigma). if the probability previously been sufficiently reduced, Bomba through violence search method to find the Enigma key (machine setting) for sending or receiving a message. Later design and construction of a similar machine \"Bombes\" of the British and American Bombs details <br> breakthrough achieved by the Poles in Warsaw on July 25, 1939 meeting held by the allies (British and French intelligence institutions) aware in September 1938, the German army Enigma modified greatly increased, leading to the difficulty of deciphering the The war is coming, the Poles, the lack of resources, they decided to seek help in various efforts, the British (at Bletchley manor, and later there are Americans) not only succeeded in deciphering the German Army Enigma communication, but also decipher the German Air Force, the Nazi secret police, and (more difficult to decipher) German naval Enigma communications. rightly feel that, Ray Aliyev Chomsky cryptanalysis concept breakthrough in the early 1930s, is made by the individual contribution of the Allies win World War II. <br> Reyes Minkowski and many other members of the password at the in Germany attacked Poland, was removed to retreat to the rear. many of them, including Reyes to Minkowski, go PC Bruno intelligence station in France continue to decipher Enigma communications. Reyes Hargreaves PC Bruno off, they base of some of the people went to the United Kingdom, but in the UK, he has not engaged in cryptanalysis, Bletchley Manor in cryptanalysis work decrypt the message until the 1970s, Reyes Minkowski learned that he began in the early 1930s The importance of the work. <br>, Marian Rejewski (left) <br> after World War II, in 1946, Reyes Minkowski back to reunite with his wife and two children in Poland. his work in a factory in Poland until retirement, and his own work made in the pre-war and wartime remain silent. <br> the process of deciphering the Enigma, he wrote a book about his work and the two the papers, although this book in his lifetime not published. Reyes Minkowski died in Warsaw in 1980, (l $ j而.c里) buried in Poland&#39;s Powazki Cemetery. <br> Poland math will give him awarded over a particularly Medal. <br> the cryptanalysis during World War II, he played the role and contributions are not known in a long period of time, which resulted in at least a best-selling book (William Stevenson, A Man Called Intrepid, 1976) not only did not give his contribution the considerable honor (restated a &#39;steal from the transport truck to the Enigma machine&#39; has a different version of the legend), and even his name and gender mistake (the book is called \"Marian Miss ﹞ 濘痲珖佴價, (Mademoiselle Marian Rewjeski)\"). <br>'
