'cont'=>'December 26, 1898 (the Reform Movement in the winter months xiv), Marie Curie discovered radium. <br> Marie Curie <br> 1898 12, 26, Mary, in a report submitted to the French Academy of Sciences announced that they discovered a new element than uranium radioactive stronger millions of times - & mdash ; radium. Pierre Curie and his wife, Mary Sike Luo Tao the Kosovska married 3 years, the great love of crystallization. believe in the whole theory of centuries in the field of physics <br> The discovery turned upside down. Conservative scientists skeptical \"radium Where? Refers to look at us, we can believe that! \"Pierre and Marie are determined to answer to the fact that all of this suspect. However, to extract the pure radium, there must be a lot of minerals and a large laboratory. Pitchblende is a mineral of the most expensive, they can not afford, and later in Austria, a professor&#39;s help, they spent all of the deposits, and sold all the valuable things before they buy a dozen sacks pitchblende slag. For the laboratory, the the Curies in negotiations with the University of Paris, answer their is some merciless ridicule. Finally, physicochemical schools agreed to supply them a long time without the woodshed. Woodshed ground is paved with asphalt, glass roof dilapidated Debu shield the wind and rain. Indoor only two old table, a stove and a Pierre used for the calculation of small blackboard. The Curies it great scientific experiments in this broken house. like water <br> sun and the moon, the Curies as if in a dream, to forget the time, regardless of winter or summer, intense work, regardless of the night and day, all day. Their health compromised because of too little sleep, too much physical exertion. Pierre, body aches, Mary obviously thinner, but they insisted, it took 45 months of labor, refined after tens of thousands of times, finally managed to get the 10 grams of pure radium. Radium found, and soon discovered radium cancer treatment efficacy, the radium price soaring, some friends persuaded the Curies application patent, this patent, The Curies blink of an eye it will become the world wealthy. However, Pierre said: \"No! We should not make money from the discovery of a new atom. Radium both a kindness substances Saving the world, this thing should be part of the world. \"<br> Pierre Curie was born in Paris, France on May 15, 1859. His father was a doctor. Pierre and his brother&#39;s elementary education at home and their parents to take a more liberal approach to education, in addition to the scheme of arrangement provides for learning, but also to encourage them to read more reading materials, as well as multi-touch with nature, develop their ability to observe things in the outing. Pierre, the 16-year-old University of Paris, University of Arts and Sciences degree, 18-year-old physics master&#39;s degree, and stayed on to any lab assistant. 1883, Pierre was appointed director of the Paris City physicochemical school physics laboratory. <br> Marie Curie, French Poles, born on November 7, 1867 in a family of intellectuals in Warsaw, Poland, she the original Ming Mali ・ 斯克罗多夫斯 card. Her father is a graduate of the University of St. Petersburg, and later taught mathematics and physics in a secondary school in Warsaw. In 1891, Mary said goodbye to his family, was admitted to the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, began postgraduate. In 1893, she graduated from the Physics Department of the University of Paris, runner-class degree in Physics from. The second year she graduated from the Department of Mathematics, ranked second in the whole class, a master&#39;s degree in mathematics. After graduation, she wanted to return to Poland to work, however, she met a young Frenchman physicist Pierre Curie, after marriage to stay in France. the <br> 1903 years, the Curies discovered radioactive elements won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Curie-Sklodowska <br> Marie Curie do experimental <br> the Pierre Curie <br> Nobel Prize winner Marie ranking Lane (Marie Curie) <br>'
