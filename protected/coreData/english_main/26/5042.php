'cont'=>'May 26, 1967 April 18 (DingWei years), China&#39;s first successful launch of a ground-to-ground medium-range missiles. The <br> China&#39;s first successful launch of a ground-to-ground medium-range missiles <br> 1967 May 26, 2010, China&#39;s first successful launch of a ground-to-ground medium-range missiles. The mid-1950s, China began development emerging cause of missiles, after 50 years of construction and development of ground strategic, tactical missiles, from liquid to solid, from short-range to intercontinental launched from land to underwater submarine-launched, launched from fixed positions to motor hidden transmitter, and have an effective nuclear deterrent and defensive counterattack force; air defense missile has formed a high-altitude, low-altitude, low-altitude surface-to-air missile series has a different means of transmission, air defense equipment to attack different airspace system; Cruise Missile formation of a coast-to-ship, ship, air-to-ship, submarine coastal defense missile series, with the anti-landing, blocking important waters and offshore operations. Of various types of missiles has formed a complete weapons systems, greatly enhance the national defense capabilities, and a sturdy steel barrier erected for the country&#39;s territory, airspace and territorial waters, and become an important force in consolidating national defense, defending the motherland security. <br> of ground-to-ground ballistic missile technology from generic Soviet P-2 short-range missiles started. This code 1059 of the short-range missile, later named as the \"Dongfeng One. Its rocket engine using liquid oxygen and alcohol as a propellant, the control system uses inertial and radio cross partial correction of mixed guidance system. November 5, 1960, a Dongfeng One short-range ground-to-ground missiles in one fell swoop was successfully launched, which is an important turning point in the history of China&#39;s military equipment. Liquid ballistic missile. Since 1960, China started to develop, in imitation of short-range missiles based on short-range liquid ballistic missile the \"Dongfeng II\". Major research projects are: to improve the engine thrust and specific thrust and extended working hours to 40% of the liquid oxygen tank by the two-tier structure to a single-layer structure, the tail section from convergence type steel structure into a cylindrical aluminum structures and so on. The overall layout of the missiles, control systems and ground equipment the Dongfeng One much the same. Dongfeng II in our own design and development of short-range missiles after a launch failure, the first successful flight test on June 29, 1964. Subsequently conducted several experiments were successful, this indicates that China has embarked on a road of self-developed missile. <br> 1964, China formulated the \"eight four bomb\" planning, that from 1965 to 1972 from the short-range research task to remote four ground-to-ground missile models. Decision in 1965, the 2nd missile Dongfeng improved by increasing the range of 20% for the two bombs combined \"test set out atomic bomb head. On October 27, 1966 after an improved design Dongfeng No. 2 A missile carrying the atomic bomb \"two bombs combined flight test missile fly, and accurate fly to the drop zone and to achieve a nuclear explosion. Since then, China has its own nuclear missiles, and to break the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1965, China started to develop \"Dongfeng III\" medium-range ground-to-ground missiles, launched on May 26, 1967 and June 10, two successful trials. The <br> worth mentioning is that the \"Dongfeng IV\" long-range missile over a series of new technologies. In the development process, the two-stage rocket, connection and separation, the second stage engine altitude ignition and stable in the near-vacuum conditions, the oxidizer tank and fuel tank, bottom, weak vibration and shaking of the strapdown full compensation guided warheads technical issues such as anti-heat high-speed re-entry are breakthrough. Experienced a failure of the flight test, the January 30, 1970, in the fourth Dongfeng long-range missile test-launch a complete success. \"Dongfeng V ICBM developed to take some new technical solutions, determine the power unit with storable nitrogen tetroxide and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine propellant, an engine from the single parallel, the second stage engine of a main engine and swimming in the engine control system platform of choice for computer and the triaxial static pressure flotation gyro stabilized platform. September 10, 1971, the wind on the 5th ICBMs research validation flight tests, basically achieve the purpose of the test missile design and system suitability. May <br> 1980 18, China&#39;s first intercontinental missile Dongfeng fifth after 30 minutes to pull off from the Jiuquan launch base across the sky, the spread upward Miles, accurate target sea area of &#8203;&#8203;the South Pacific splashdown , the whole successful flight test. Since then, China has become the world&#39;s third country to conduct a the ICBMs full flight test, this is a new milestone in the development of China&#39;s strategic missile. Solid ballistic missiles. In 1967, China&#39;s strategic missile from liquid to solid, that the missile power plant transition to the use of solid-fuel rocket engine liquid fuel rocket engine. Solid missile has a compact structure, high reliability, good mobility, less auxiliary equipment, maintenance simple, survival ability, short launch preparation time, the transition from liquid missile solid missile marks to-ground ballistic missile technology development to a new stage. (Lssjt.cn) <br> the same year, a 1.4 m diameter solid engine developed in China by a full hot commissioning, solid engine already has a certain basis, so decided to develop the equipment of solid strategic missile submarines. This solid missile was later named \"the waves on the 1st. <br> in the development process, to overcome the underwater launch, the materials and structures of the large-scale solid rocket motor, control system platform computer, remote security device, engine altitude ignition technical difficulties. In accordance with the \"station, tube, boat\" three-step procedure, by the land-based telemetry missile launch pad, the status of the trial of three land-based launch tube and conventional submarines launch, in 1982, the waves on the 1st research and development into the submarine underwater launch the implementation phase of the trial. This decision in March, named \"9182\" the submarine underwater the solid missile test launch waves on the 1st of the task must be completed before September 1982, at 12:00 all test preparations. \"9182\" task to mobilize the 20 held <br> 1982. On October 1, the Xinhua News Agency authorized to post announcements, announced the launch vehicle test our seas will be held from October 7 to October 26. October 7, fired the first rounds of waves on the 1st telemetry missile submarine underwater, but the water ignition soon, the missile out of control flip in the air, self-destructive test failed. Lessons learned analysis of telemetry data to find the cause of the failure to take measures to eliminate instability poses failure. October 12, submarines second rounds of the telemetry bomb underwater launch, missile flight predetermined trajectory, warheads accurately fall into the target sea area, flight test a complete success. The solid strategic missile was successfully launched waves on the 1st, and new improvement and development of China&#39;s strategic missile technology. China has become the world&#39;s fifth country to have submarines underwater missile launch capability. At the same time, it was decided that the latent-ground missiles from underwater onto land, developed land maneuver solid missile. The key is to complete a design can transport, erection and launch missiles car. After a year of research, to solve a series of technical problems. April 1984, full weapon system joint training missiles and ground equipment, a comprehensive test equipment design and performance of a variety of vehicles. In May 1985, China&#39;s self-developed solid strategic missile from underwater launch motor moved onshore emission models in one fell swoop successfully launched. Later, another aim, adapters and other equipment has been improved, with improved ground equipment in May 1987 firing test was a complete success. This marks the land-based mobile solid strategic missile reached a new level of technology. <br> 20 1990s, China&#39;s new generation of ground-to-ground tactical and strategic missile development and make new progress. Missile launch training, held in the East China Sea in July 1995, the latest development of the ground-to-ground missile launchers all accurately hit the target; the southeast coastal military exercises held in March 1996, launch a new ground-to-ground missile accurately hit targets. August 2, 1999, China successfully carried out in the territory of a new long-range ground-to-ground missile test launch, which marks the Chinese missile technology boarded a new development height. <br>'
