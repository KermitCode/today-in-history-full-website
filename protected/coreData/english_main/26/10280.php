'cont'=>'October 26, 2010 (September 19), GY, Chang&#39;e II satellite successfully entering the the Rainbow Moon Bay imaging track. chart of <br> <br>: \"Chang&#39;e II\" successfully entered lunar Rainbow Bay imaging orbit Xinhua News Agency issued <br> Xinhua Beijing Oct. 26 Xinhua (Reporter Tian Siu Yun Jiang Ning) at 21:27 on the 26th, the Beijing Aerospace Control Center implemented the Chang&#39;e II satellite lower track control about 18 minutes later, the satellite successfully entered the Apolune 100 km, the perilune 15 km test track , ready to capture an image the Moon Rainbow Bay. <br> journalists to see on the big screen from the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center hall control instruction is issued, 3D animation, and four small satellites engines spew bright flame. Judgment based on the real-time telemetry data, the drop rail to achieve the desired effect. <br> To ensure control foolproof, the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center with non-symmetric orbit control technology, an effective solution to the perilune low height, measurement and control is not visible, the gravitational field of the moon orbit perilune rapid decline of rail impact of large technical problems, and greatly enhance the control reliability. According to Zhou Jianliang, deputy chief engineer of the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center <br> lower orbit satellite moves closer to the moon, to high-resolution imaging of the lunar Rainbow Bay. 26 the evening of the implementation of the the perilune 15 km control, high control accuracy requirements. Under the influence of the gravitational field of the moon, the satellite orbit perilune rapid decline, drift prone to orbit. In addition, the engine ignition orbit, the satellite right in the side of the moon, in the \"blind control\" difficult to control and greatly increases the risk. If the engine is not timely shutdown, control the amount of precision will make satellite collision month or derail, resulting task fall short. It is reported that <br> 27, the CCD camera on Chang&#39;e II satellite lunar Rainbow Bay Area will take pictures. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> <br> Review: China Aerospace lunar program to the successful completion of the task of planning this step, congratulations China Aerospace. <br>'
