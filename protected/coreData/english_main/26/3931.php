'cont'=>'April 26, 1994 (Awake, March 16), the the American the Vermillion Laboratory physicist found items quark. The quark of <br> composed of elementary particles smaller than protons, neutrons substance. Before the 1960s, the physics community protons, neutrons minimal material composed of particles. The experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the scientists believe that the quark 6. (U up quarks, down quarks d, c charm quark, s strange quark, t the top quark and b quark) the first 4,5 kinds of quarks the in 1963 after <br>, scientists have been discovered, including the charm quark \" The group of researchers led by Chinese scientist Samuel Ting discovered in 1974. Three years later, the group of researchers led by Li Deman has also confirmed the existence of the bottom quark. Find the last quark in the past 19 years of efforts in the direction of the particle physicist only confirmed the existence of the top quark, the theory of particle physics in order to obtain verification. The top quark mass exceeding the scientists speculate. The top quark mass is about 200 times the mass of the proton, proton collision ways top quark mass and energy conversion formula in accordance with the theory of relativity, the movement of protons at very high speed, the faster the speed, the higher the energy of collision the moment in order to produce the top quark. the <br> Fermilab accelerator circumference of 6.3km, 1,000 superconducting magnets to accelerate protons and antiprotons to each of nine hundred billion electron volts of energy, collision an average of 1 trillion collision may be observed once the top quark. After the emergence of the top quark, \"and then\" disappeared. The experiments show that the top quark appears in the 1 ¡Á 10-24s (observer had a chance to blink moment) decaying into other particles. <br> 1964 Gherman quark model meson is composed of the quark and anti-quark baryon is made of three quarks. So he won the 1969 Prize for Physics. <br>'
