'cont'=>'November 26, 1504 (October 20) Jiazi Spanish Queen Isabel I of the death. <br> Isabel I of Isabel I (1451 -1504 years, November 26, 2011), Custer Queen reign (1474-1504), Queen of Spain (1479-1504) <br> order certain reasons and purposes, we dispatch noble Cristobal Columbus led three well-equipped sailing across the seas to carry some gifts, towards India - Isabel I and his wife sent to Columbus the pass <br> of ; 1492, Spain as if suddenly became the center of the world. This year, a miracle coming to the the many vicissitudes kingdom on the Iberian Peninsula. Which obviously should be attributed to the efforts of Queen Isabel I, and its Fufeidinan II. Iberian Peninsula on the <br> <br> Middle Ages, there are many Islamic and Catholic countries. After hundreds of years of mergers in the mid-15th century, mainly the rest of the western Portugal, the middle of Custer and eastern Aragon Three Kingdoms, plus the peninsula southernmost Moose Lin Xiaoguo Grenada, one of the most powerful The Caster Kingdom. (L $ j而.c里) Isabel is the daughter of the the Custer King Juan II and Princess of Portugal. In 1454, Juan II died, Isabel&#39;s half-brother, Enrique IV (nicknamed \"incompetent) to the throne. <br> girlhood Isabel did not have a smooth, Enrique throne after her mother, brother Alfonso moved to Arevalo a claustrophobic castle residence. His mother (and woman with the same name, also known as Isabel) mentally ill, and sometimes seizures. But this does not affect the good education of Isabel by teachers from the University of Salamanca. In 1468, Enrique IV dissatisfied nobles crowned Alfonso King, the civil war which began a Xiongdixiqiang, (lsjt.org) near Alfonso died suddenly against Enrique IV nobility and carried out of Princess Isabel to continue to confront. Finally the two sides finally reached a meeting to stop the civil war, all the nobles were required to swear allegiance to Enrique IV, Princess Isabel, heir to the throne, but that her marriage must be approved by the Wang Xiong&#39;s. Isabel princess sent <br> very scheming cronies attendants the nations private visit of the young prince. Feedback conclusion Aragon the Prince Ferdinand Pinmao superior heroic. Isabel will finally set for life private with Ferdinand communication between. But Enrique IV take her to marry King Afonso V of Portugal widowed, attempt to Isabel arrested. Thus, in 1469, Isabel quickly with Prince Ferdinand engagement, and then with the Aragonese army forcibly resists Wang Xiong interference. This seems like a dramatic affair, and ultimately the sake of the unity of Spain as a nation. <br> Enrique IV Isabel grounds of non-compliance with agreements, deprived of her right to inherit, The Stand, his own daughter, Juana, but due Enrique sexual incompetent in the name of most of the nobility think Juana&#39;s descent in doubt. In 1474, Enrique died, Isabel and Juana declared himself the throne, they were with the power of her husband Aragon and Portugal, the support of the domestic part of the aristocracy. After four years of war, the Portuguese army was defeated, Isabel finally firmly secured the throne. In 1479, Ferdinand also inherited the throne of Aragon, the two merged to become the Kingdom of Spain (two countries remained separate parliamentary, legal and tax system). <br> Isabel born by the queen of the mentally ill, and her daughter \"madwoman\" Juana, but she was quick-witted, strong-willed. Her with Ferdinand as king, is a powerful combination of typical. Most of the nobility of the opposition has been cleared in a civil war, so Isabel can strengthen the centralization. She reverted to the mayor power to appoint all the king, the establishment of the Holy Brotherhood armed control of municipal life, Parliament in line with the dummy, the destruction of aristocratic castle, confiscated aristocratic Enrique IV era from the royal territory, and on Grenada use of troops to the ground, to maintain a strong standing army. Spanish monarchy reached an unprecedented level. (L $ dj而.身r阱) <br> Spain&#39;s history is the Christian princes since the 11th century, the Islamic kingdom constantly capture the history of the site, known as the \"re-conquest movement, to Isabel era, Muslims in Spain only under the the southernmost last stronghold - Grenada Kingdom. History this honor to the couple Isabel, in 1490 two of the king personally led the army arrives, Ferdinand II in the frontline fight in Isabel center scheduling, and is responsible for the logistical supply, and also established a field hospital. 1492, after eight months of siege, Grenada gunned Balladur, the last King of the drop, the peninsula was finally unified under the umbrella of Christ. <br> this day, all European Catholic church bells sounding. <br> but as a devout Catholic couple King, the territory of infidels, Jews and Muslims were persecuted, and the establishment of the Inquisition. Wealth and technology in 1492, 200,000 Jews were deported, 10 the Hou Moer people suffered the same fate. This may be all pious king of the medieval common shortcoming, they are widely respected in the Catholic world, has a clear conscience, crimes committed against the infidels. Their religious policies successor continue culminate in Carlos I and Philip II era. In the system of the Inquisition, Spain lost the aura, gradually turned into a dead corner (while at the same time, the gorgeous Renaissance is the spread of other European countries). affect the maximum at <br> but Isabel history does not lie in these, but rather to fund Columbus feat. The abjection of the prodigal son in after hitting the wall after 10 years, finally won in the court of Isabel ideal newborn. Columbus&#39;s a great idea to get the appreciation of the queen and the generous donation, which is said Isabel even come up with their own money, and Columbus has been called the Ocean Fleet Commander and Governor of land will be found. In 1492, the greatest year in the history of Spain, Columbus expedition After 70 days of sailing, finally reached the Bahamas in North America. The discovery of the New World to Spain brought a broad space. A century thereafter, Spain rely on vast overseas territories and the steady stream of gold input to establish world hegemony. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> Isabel my marriage affect the history of her arranged marriage to their children based on political considerations. Her daughter \"madwoman\" Juana is married to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian&#39;s son, the Netherlands monarch and Philip, and their son Carlos I (also known as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), inherited the vast empire, including Spain, the Netherlands, (lssjt.cn) Austria. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> Isabel lifetime diligent, her five children, all born on the road. She may have got a little older, always wearing a white dress, the famous \"white queen\". <br> for the history of each pair of husband and king, it is difficult to the respective roles of the strict division open. She and Ferdinand II is a powerful combination, but traditionally considered her role to be more prominent. In the middle of many efforts, Ferdinand II may also be attributed to the name of Isabel. <br> single sponsor the Columbus voyage that matter, she is enough to be discharged into the ranks of the world&#39;s most influential emperors. At present, there are people of the Old World before Columbus arrived in the Americas, several hypotheses, but in any case, only Columbus&#39;s feat has opened up new routes, even as one of the old and the new continent. On the other hand, it is Spain, rather than in other countries first possession of the Americas, which makes the culture of the Americas in most parts of Spain branded imprint continues today. (History com) <br> addition, Isabel to Spain to lay the basis of political unity, and efforts to ideologically dominate Spain. To establish the hegemony of Spain in the next 100 years, she left beyond the scope of the Iberian Peninsula, as far as Latin America, the Netherlands and other places. Isabel ranking female emperor in the book the most front. <br> Review: Catholic fanaticism and the strong desire of the Catholic world domination, is the guiding ideology and the spiritual power of Isabel I of the ruling. This irrational ruling ideology in the era of Isabel has become a unified Spain, to strengthen the cohesion of the country, to establish overseas career driving force. However, a century later, this ruling ideology clearly showing the negative side, become root Spain fading. This shows that the ruling ideas of any kind, even if we can bring about the effect of the moment, after all, is not a long-term policy. [L $ j而.c里] <br>'
