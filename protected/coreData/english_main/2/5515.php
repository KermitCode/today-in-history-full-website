'cont'=>'June 2, 1998 (, May eighth day), Tiger years, China and the United States work together to create the human universe antimatter detection of a new era. <br> June 1998, U.S. Eastern Daylight Time 18:10 (Beijing time on June 3, 6AM Ê± 10 points), Florida, in the United States is willing to session Di space launch center, human first a strong magnetic spectrometer into space, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) - Alpha magnetic spectrometer AMS (AlphaMagneticSpectrometer), by the U.S. space shuttle \"Discovery\" antimatter and dark matter in space probe studies, and measuring the composition of the elements in the universe. It is the human a cross the world&#39;s major research projects, but also the technical aspects of Sino-US space first major cooperation. <br> many years, humans have been using light to cosmic observations, including visible light, radio waves, microwaves, X-rays, and Y-rays, etc.. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS into space is the direct observation of the first human on the charged particles of the universe, and it has opened up a whole new field of science, and is likely to bring a physical science major breakthrough. <br> lasted more than two years of the AMS experiment plan is a famous Chinese-American physicist and Nobel laureate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Samuel Ting, under the leadership of a large-scale international cooperation in scientific experiments project, including the United States, 37 research institutions, the participation of physicists and engineers from more than 10 countries and regions including China, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and other countries. Electrotechnology Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of High Energy Physics, Space Center and the China Carrier Rocket Technology Research Institute and other units to participate in this program, and played a key role in which cooperation with NASA. <br> It is understood that AMS magnetic spectrometer after the first flight in June of this year, will begin to enter the second phase project: perfect a project has been completed in the main detector based on the increase in the number of new sub-detectors , in order to further improve the measurement precision, to expand the detection range, and to reduce system error. January 19, 2002, it will be jointly developed by the United States, Russia, Western Europe, Japan and Canada, by the space shuttle to the International Space Station, scheduled to run for 3-5 years. To this end, the Ministry of Science and Technology in China, the National Natural Science Fund Committee and the Chinese Academy of Sciences has planned units in an effort to support funding for China. <br> AMS experiment is a cross-century major international scientific experimental project, the Sino-US cooperation, strengthen exchanges in science and technology between China and the United States, to promote friendship and common development of the two peoples, has an extremely important significance, is bound to have a profound impact on Sino-US technology sector. In the future, China and the United States in the future will be in the AMS program, equipped with bucket plans (United States Space Agency Aerospace aircraft equipped with buckets to carry out a series of space science experiments) and other aerospace technology to carry out more extensive cooperation. People expect that the Sino-US AMS project can become a successful cooperation between the two countries as well as cooperation with European countries in the field of space technology, to jointly develop a new era of common progress. <br>'
