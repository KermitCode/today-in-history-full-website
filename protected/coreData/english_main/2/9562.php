'cont'=>'October 2, 1909 (, Jiyou August 19), the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway opened to traffic. <br> 1909 10, 2, 2009, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway from Beijing to Zhangjiakou in South Side, held a grand opening ceremony. The railway is China&#39;s own survey, their design, their construction built. This project is presided over by the our outstanding engineers Zhantianyou. Represented born in the family of a decline of the tea merchants in Nanhai, Guangdong. His age of 12 to study in the United States, where lived there for 10 years, and finally graduated from Yale University, Department of Civil Engineering. He study hard, the results were quite good, graduation exams won first place. 1881 Represented returning from school. In 1905, Zhan Tianyou was hired as the chief engineer, presided over the construction of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway is a very difficult project. From Beijing to Zhangjiakou, over 200 km of the entire complex terrain, mountains lie the meantime. Juyongguan, Qinglongqiao to the Badaling section of the road, the terrain, especially from the South Side, north getting higher and higher, and is full of cliffs, very steep slope. At that time, some foreign engineers and technicians do not believe that the Chinese the Xiu railway, public ridicule, said: \"The construction of this railway engineer, afraid not born miles! \"<br> The Zhan Tianyou With motherland enthusiasm, confidence invested intense work. He led the engineering and technical personnel, the back of the benchmark, theodolite, riding a donkey, over the mountains all day running around in the wilderness of the mountains. Beyond the Great Wall of sand, often winds came in gusts, Fui Sha sky, blowing open eyes, the slightest mistake, it will fall into the bottomless ravine.

He often reminded aides said: \"you may have thought, how significant your shoulders responsibility ah! Engineering and technical requirements of the first precision can not be a little vague, sloppy, &#39;probably&#39;, &#39;almost&#39; such words, is not allowed from the mouth of our engineering and technical personnel! \"He&#39;s a serious and responsible spirit, inspiring people work together, spirit hundredfold work. The various difficulties oncoming after the start of the project <br>. Zhan Tianyou and painstakingly trying, against all odds, one begins to push forward the project. Total Juyongguan, after the rail line was constructed through the south exit, Wuguishan head, shifosi the Badaling four tunnels, total length of 1645 meters. This is the key to the success of the whole project. Represented made up my determination, do not get through a day, on the day of return to Beijing. His bold use of blasted rock and chisel shaft dug finally overcome a difficult period to get through the long tunnel of the time in the world was still a rare. <br> After four years of hard work, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was completed in September 1909, and opened to traffic on October 2. This original program takes six years to complete the project, only four years, but also save a lot of project costs. Represented excellence, winning glory for the Chinese people. In 1919, Zhan Tianyou&#39;s death, people Qinglongqiao station built a Zhantianyou systemic bronze statue to commemorate the patriotic engineers immortal performance. <br>'
