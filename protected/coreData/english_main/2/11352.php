Reference December 1996, the United States Intel Corporation for the U.S. Department of Energy recently developed the world&#39;s fastest supercomputer, 1.4 trillion operations per second, the first time in the history of the development of supercomputers per second million billion mark. <br> researchers said the computer development cost of $ 55 million, it written calculation can be completed within 15 seconds to take 25 million years, the personal computer needs to run two days to complete the task of computing. The previous fastest supercomputer developed by Hitachi, Japan in 1995, its operating speed is 368 billion times per second, while Intel&#39;s supercomputer speed equivalent to 3 times. <br> the supercomputer developed for the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, it will mainly be used to simulate nuclear tests, and the forecasting of weather and natural disasters, the amount of genetic research, space simulation data enormous research work. <br>'
