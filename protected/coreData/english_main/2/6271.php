'cont'=>'July 2, 1698 (May 25) Tiger years, Thomas Sa appointed Swiss to obtain the patent of the steam engine. <br> Thomas Sa Committee, Swiss, July 2, 1698, the steam engine patent! the <br> Thomas Sa appointed Swiss is a British military engineer, an invention is the world&#39;s first Pipi steam engine home, (on TodayOnHistory.com) standard called \"Friends of the miners&#39; British patent in 1698. He will be an egg-shaped container first full steam, and then close the steam inlet valve in a container outside the spray of cold water to make steam condensation and the formation of a vacuum container. Open the inlet valve, the water in the bottom of the mine affected by atmospheric pressure by the the inlet pipe inhalation container; close the inlet valve, and re-entered the steam valve, water container through the drain valve is pressed out by the steam pressure. Water container to be emptied and filled with steam, close the steam inlet valve and drain valve, re-spray the steam condensation. This repeated cycle, alternating with two egg-shaped container work, continuous drainage. <br> Savery water pumping machine relying on vacuum suction to draw water, the to Kap Shui depth of not more than six meters. In order to draw water from a few tens of meters deep mine water pumping machine must be installed in the depths of the mine, with a higher vapor pressure to the hydraulic pressure to the ground, this was undoubtedly a difficult and dangerous. <br> later, there have been more improved the steam engine, which is the most famous in watts, these improved machine made a great contribution to the industrial revolution in Europe. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) <br> In fact, many inventions are like this, patents are not descendants know, made improved reputation. Anyway, this invention is one of the best inventions ever in the U.S. \"Time\" magazine judges. <br>'
