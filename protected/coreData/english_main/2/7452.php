'cont'=>'August 2, 1849 (, Jiyou June 14), the death of Egypt, Mohammed Ali Pasha. <br> Muhammad Ali Pasha, Egypt, August 2 (1769 -1849 years ago has been 163 years), Egypt Pasha (1805-1849 reign), an Ottoman Empire in Egypt Pasha (Governor). He is often referred to as the founder of modern Egypt. Muhammad Ali&#39;s ancestors Albanian, he is a young man beginning the sale of tobacco, and later joined the Ottoman army. <br> 163 years later, the Western European civilization in the science and technology and cultural aspects made a breakthrough, and gradually became the dominant force in leading the advance of world civilization. Wave expansion of Western civilization, the response of the Asia-Africa many with a long history of civilization can be broadly divided into three categories, the threat of Western European civilization before the arrival of the initiative to implement the change actively catch up with the trend, reform of Peter I of Russia part of this type, another invasion of Western European civilization, the face of gunboats last resort to accept each other&#39;s transformation, passive integration into the Western civilization dominated world order, and most of the Asian and African countries belong to this type. There is also a just threatened, they assess the situation and take the initiative for change, Japan&#39;s Meiji Restoration and Ali reform in Egypt are part of this type, although their outcome is quite different. (1 $ dj而.c身m) <br> dispute many of the Muhammad Ali Reform posterity. But his capacity as an outsider, so a decline of ancient regained its youthful, out of the long night, started exploring the way forward on the road of modernization difficult, this historical achievements can not be denied. Of course, the purpose of his own, he finally failed, its tragic like a Shakespeare tragedy. in 1517 became part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire <br> Egypt, but in fact remain semi-independent status as a slave by the the Mamou Crew (meaning ($ dj而.c身m) earlier recruitment from Greece, the Caucasus from later mastered the rule of the military and political power in Egypt). The Mamou Crewe implement backward package tax system, the struggle for power between factions horse wood Crewe, melee endless. The 18th century is the darkest century in Egypt, on average every 10 years, would take place the first large-scale civil war. Fertile Nile Delta, as much as 1/3 of the land abandoned agricultural output is only a quarter of the ancient population actually shrunk to half of the 10th century, once the international port city of Alexandria, was reduced to a town. (? V history today?? Com) <br> With the opening up of the international airways (? V history today?? Com) Egypt communicate the strategic importance of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are also the great powers to recognize. In 1797, Napoleon&#39;s army in Egypt, when in full swing, the sovereign state of Turkey, Egypt and its allies to send troops to Egypt, France was forced to withdraw its troops. Egypt in the post-war situation is complicated, the British soil, and Egyptian native Mamou Crewe are competing for the leadership. Finally, Muhammad Ali won a final victory. <br> Muhammad Ali Albanian childhood business his father had traveled around the young man who lost his parents, minors army after marry rich widow wife to use its financial resources to gradually emerge. In 1801, Turkey sent troops to Egypt, Ali enlisted Albania Corps is the the soil Army&#39;s main Ali its Tarawa the resourceful gradually promoted to the Legion of senior generals. After the withdrawal of the French army in 1801, Albania in Mamou Crew chieftains, (lssjt.cn) the British propped agent, as well as the soil Army Corps and the Guard factions are competing for the right to rule in Egypt, a time to kill The cries, the head changes the king of the city flag. After three years, the athletic field, a number of powerful figures has killed, Muhammad Ali rose to the most powerful figure, he has ousted the Egyptian people to the the Mamou Crewe the chieftains Baltic bottom West and Turkey Sudan row to the Governor, and finally The elders of the Legislative Council in 1805, was crowned as the new Governor of Egypt (the L $ dj而.c身m) Turkey Sudan also forced to admit that this fait accompli. the summit take full advantage of the Muhammad Ali, <br>, the support of the people, and he ascended the throne the initial achievements indeed worthy of the Egyptian people embraced. 1807, in the face of the invasion of the British army, Ali mobilize the people of the war forced the British to withdraw its troops. Mamou Crewe collude with foreign enemies in the name, Mamou Crewe elite hunting in the country in 1811, and thus the end of the history of more than 500 years Mamou Crewe control Egypt. Reform (而身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> Muhammad Ali as he took office. Improve the political aspects of the bureaucratic system, strengthen the centralization of power, the end of the chaotic situation of the political situation in the past few centuries. He abolished the the package tax system has become the root causes of corruption exploitation, and the confiscation of the land of Mamou the Crewe and Islam will be a part of these lands packet to their cronies in order to consolidate the rule of force, and give less to landless farmers in order to win over the people. <br> agriculture of this is especially true for a living by the river of Egypt. Muhammad Ali era achievements in agriculture, water conservancy, doubling of arable land, agricultural technology breakthrough land from one crop annually developed to the annual three-crop, the famous long-fiber cotton widely grown. And mitigate taxes denomination of farmers in order to promote the production enthusiasm. <br> Muhammad Ali, encourage the creation of a number of modern industry, which is closely related to the shipbuilding industry and military and the arms industry is particularly compelling, these industries developed rapidly under the guidance of the technician in Western Europe. The development of industry and agriculture to promote the prosperity of commerce, and the doubling of imports and exports, and exports more than it imports. Egypt&#39;s industrial and commercial development with the nature of the state monopoly, almost all the industrial and export is controlled by the Government, Ali the treasury thus filling up. Muhammad Ali (lssjt.cn) <br> Egypt faced severe international situation will not forget. Wallets, they begin to develop the military. Traditional mercenary system was the conscription replaced. After years of efforts, one including 230,000 Army, 15,000 Navy, 32 warships, equipped with modern firearms army established. <br> Ali also founded a number of non-religious College, selected students to Western Europe, published in foreign scientific and technical books, the intelligentsia of fresh air also spread. <br> Ali reform involves a very wide range, longer duration of, from 1805 until 1840, so in many ways a qualitative change in Egypt. But military origin Ali blood is always flowing with a militant, advocating empire factors such factors as Ali has brought a series of honors, but also ultimately led to the disaster. In 1811, Ali sent troops to suppress the Wahhabis on the Arabian Peninsula, and later to force Sudan to surrender. Egypt&#39;s national strength and military power has actually exceeded the sovereign state of Turkey. Egypt to help Turkey&#39;s repression of the Greek revolution, but Turkey is unwilling to fulfill the promise of Syria and Crete let out, so the soil and Egypt led to war. The first the soil Aye war Ali victory, before and after 1833 he and his country reached its peak period, seems to have a cross-Afro-Asian empire. Ali even initiation of the plan to establish an all Arabic-speaking region, including the new Arab empire, however, those with vested interests in the international order together this wonderful dream shattered. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> Egypt \"arrogant\" makes it a target for international. Britain does not allow such an important strategic position to compete with it power, will unite with Turkey launched a second soil Aye war. The face of the rapid development of the British industrial revolution stage, Egypt, after all, not rivals. The 1840 in West Asia battlefield comprehensive defeat the second year of successful British landed in Alexandria. Ali in the past by virtue of the power of the people, repeatedly beat an opponent, but the successive years of war has made him lose the support of the people, unable to resist the British forces Ali was forced to accept a humiliating peace, to sell all the land in the West and Libya, leaving only Egypt and Sudan , Navy all handed over to the British Army to retain only one-tenth. <br> At this point, the political Muhammad Ali is actually already dead, he suppressed into the illness, insanity, since 1841, by the eldest son Ibrahim Regent. His life has been maintained to 1849 when 80-year-old. <br> after the defeat of Egypt gradually became a semi, commercial and industrial recession greatly controlled by the British and French. But the start of Egypt Muhammad Ali modernization process, after all, have been difficult to prevent. More importantly, Egypt became the bridgehead acceptance of Western ideas and advanced technology in the Arab world. The latter half of the 19th century Arab advances in molecular base of most of Egypt. As a change in the political landscape in the Middle East and the modernization process of the emperors, Muhammad Ali, the column names in the Top 65. <br> Review: Egypt because of the opening of the new overseas routes decline of the value of the two oceans because the waterway communication rediscover revival. Muhammad Ali&#39;s heroic era can not be separated from the background of the Egyptian revival, but it is his vision to promote the revival of Egypt. Without Muhammad Ali in Egypt in the 19th century is likely to let the powers exploited fish from his Egypt suffered what form of predatory, it&#39;s status as an independent political entity can not shake. <br>'
