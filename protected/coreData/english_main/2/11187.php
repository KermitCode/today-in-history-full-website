But he does not want to open their own identity in the media, \"online and the two societies, interlinked love does not make sense is the identity, so even his units welcome Miss did not know her boss is Old Banyan. <br> Turning to testify in court, the old Banyan told reporters, the Fuzhou Chen cone, Chen Yan two brothers in their own store telephone network (also known as IP telephony), the result is the bureau informant. The Chen Brothers computers and $ 50,000 money withheld by the public security department on suspicion of \"illegal business telecommunications sin\". The Chen Brothers refused to accept, then sued the Public Security. Chen brothers in the first instance, after losing an appeal to the Fuzhou Intermediate People&#39;s Court. <br> old Banyan said: \"with Chen Brothers netizens found via the Internet, said the judge asked the appeal and the appealing party of the experts, to testify for the principle of IP telephony and related technologies.

The old Banyan, \"to the court, before I met online &#39;understanding&#39; has long been the Chen brothers. After the old Banyan court of <br> what <br> in court, the old Banyan left hand on the Constitution of the People&#39;s Republic of China, solemnly read out a \"witness oath, open the laptop, argument began layers. \"Hands on the constitutional oath, I am very excited, a sacred mission. As a witness, my obligation is to answer the court asked the technical issues of IP telephony. Judges are more concerned about the principle of IP telephony, trends, whether using IP telephony to others so technical problems caused by the infringement. Old Banyan said. testimony the old <br> Yung in court, summed up in several aspects: the IP phone is one of the basic functions of the Internet, its principles and traditional phone is very different from the perspective of technology development, it is & ldquo ; communications Bell invented the telephone in the history of since the second milestone. The technically and network technology development, IP telephony and traditional telephony management equated, in fact, and the e-mail and regular mail equated ridiculous. IP telephony impact on traditional telecommunications, like the year the impact of the program-controlled switches to a human operator, the impact of advanced technology, not only should not be suppressed, but should be encouraged. \"Science and technology have become the primary productive force, lies in its ability to continue to lower cost, more comfortable, and more convenient means to meet the demand.\" The old Banyan, \"The law should protect IP telephony. <br> IP Phone traditional telephone the different things <br> old Banyan traditional telephone voice information is transmitted via telephone lines, and IP telephony transmission main on the Internet. IP telephony since its inception in 1995, has gone through three stages of development of the computer - the computer \",\" computer - telephone \",\" telephone - telephone \". Phone - phone communications are ordinary telephone. This makes the IP phone to be able to rival the traditional telecommunications business. <br> IP Phone workflow is like? The old Banyan For example, a user hit the telephone from Beijing in London, first dial a specific number to connect to the local gateway server, at the the gateway machine prompt, enter the called number, the gateway server via the Internet, according to the number connected to the London another gateway server, the latter a call signal through the local telephone network to call the London side, thereby establishing the connection. Here gateway server speech conversion into a digital signal, transmitted to the Internet, call London, the gateway server based on URL at the same time, the London Gateway server converted into the digital signal to the speech signal delivered to the user. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> compared with traditional telephony, IP telephony vague illnesses such as call quality, but its costs low is quite attractive. With traditional phone to make a long distance, you need a dedicated call line, so the cost is higher. The main transmission part of the IP telephony on the Internet, and Internet charges and is independent of the distance, so for long-distance communications, IP phone charges (call both city calls and Internet access fees) than traditional phone much lower. <br> IP telephone rise is the rise of IP telephony unstoppable the general trend <br> old Banyan assertion. The size of the IP telephony market growth rate of 14% per annum in recent years, is expected to total up to $ 1.8 billion 2001. In April this year, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ruled that the use of computer and special software to play the IP phone is not a long-distance telephone. According to the U.S. telecommunications strategy consulting agency estimates that, in 2000, the U.S. IP telephony call volume will exceed the traditional telephone, 2003, IP telephone services will account for 36% of the international calls market. <br> Swiss telecommunications company since July this year, down mobile phones and international long-distance telephone charges, and the creation of the Internet telephony business users a single sexual intercourse is a nominal listing fee, can be inexpensive The price to make international long distance calls via the Internet. <br> in Singapore, the telecom department plans to launch a new network, including IP telephony services. <br> in our country, IP telephony is mostly also limited to Internet cafes, with the color of the \"game\". ISP (Internet service provider) the right to operate Internet cafes, international networking business license in the IP phone here, but the relevant documents of the State defined our current computer on the Internet only to provide computer information services, they will not run telephone, fax and other telecommunication services. Nevertheless, in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and other places in fact existing of operating IP telephony business \"underground\" company. In August this year, an Internet access service in Shanghai stock company on suspicion of \"illegal business long distance business\" seizure, followed by similar cases in Guangzhou. This time Fuzhou Chen brothers suspected of \"illegal business telecommunications case further sounded the alarm. <br> Needless to say, IP telephony is an important direction for the future development of communication are experimental stage, but also in our country at this stage. According to the Chinese computer \"said Beijing telegraph office and some of the more mature technology companies joint test of IP phones, to be the appropriate policy, after the introduction of the regulations, the timely provide such services. [L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T] <br> old Banyan management system of China&#39;s telecommunications industry is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. For a long time, however, the telecommunications monopoly, and monopolistic conservative mentality, in fact, has become a major obstacle to the development of China&#39;s information industry. The telecommunications sector is both a referee in the industry, athletes, rules makers, it is unreasonable. (History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> IP phone, however backward continuous development of advanced information technology and China&#39;s telecommunications industry management system is or will be a major conflict in an example. If we bound their hands and feet, a few years you will see that its consequences. the old Banyan finally emphasized in <br> court judgment should promote rather than hinder the development of science and technology, contrary to the judgment the IP telephony necessarily popularizing the technology trends, will become the laughing stock of the history of technology. <br>'
