'cont'=>'The (GY October 27), December 2, 2010, U.S. scholars have found Life Seventh elements. under <br> <br> electron microscopy GFAJ-1 bacteria <br> <br> scientists sampling <br> the <br> scientific community in the past life by six elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur, but U.S. researchers announced on December 2, 2010, a type of bacteria found in Mono Lake in eastern California. Unlike other known life forms, this bacterium is able to rely on another element, a highly toxic arsenic (commonly known as arsenic) life. This finding broadens the scientific community awareness constitute the basic elements of life in the past (history TodayOnHistory.com) may be able to provide scientists to explore new reference extraterrestrial life: extraterrestrial life exist in another form? \"extraterrestrial bacteria <br> found alive by arsenic the <br> research report said that the bacteria can not only with the propagation of arsenic, but the arsenic in the growth process of synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and cell membrane. Search one of the authors of the study, the Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University Institute scholar Ariel Anbar said: \"this organism from nature ... is a bacteria known, not entirely new varieties but not previously found it with the arsenic breeding. \"The former Arizona State University School of Earth and Space Exploration 博士后费利萨 Wolfe Simon is the discoverer of this new life form. <br> Simon, Anbar and colleagues a few years ago began to explore an idea known life, new life forms that may exist on Earth, what scientists call \"supernatural life\". Simon said, \"We suspect that the type of organism of the Earth in ancient times there have been, and even still survive in certain special environment. \"<br> Impact explore the range of extraterrestrial life will expand <br> Fei Lisa said, this is called\" GFAJ-1 \"bacteria in the biological structure is very similar to Earth&#39;s species, but also alien biometric arsenic on behalf of phosphorus strange life forms seems to only see in science fiction, this finding will fundamentally change the way we define life, or even to find way of life ... This major discovery proved that some of the planet&#39;s atmosphere, although the lack of phosphorus such important elements of life, but it is likely there are living creatures. \"<br> If proven, arsenic does the other basic elements as the building blocks of life, scientists in the exploration of extraterrestrial life will no longer be limited to the previous six elements, and a reference for an idea . <br> For this argument, Anbar to find extraterrestrial life, there is not a small distance from the new discovery. But at least now, scientists something can be done, in addition to phosphorus, and other essential elements of whether it will be another element to replace it? Whether extraterrestrial life exists in another form of it? <br>'
