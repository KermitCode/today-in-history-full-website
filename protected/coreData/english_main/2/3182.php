'cont'=>'April 2, 1872, on February 25, (Renshen years), American scientist, the telegraph inventor of Morse&#39;s death. <br> Morse (Morse, Samrel Finley, Breese), American artist and inventor. Born April 27, 1791 in Charleston, Massachusetts (now part of Boston); April 2, 1872 and died in New York. the <br> 1810 years, (1 $ dj而.c身m) Morse graduated from Yale University, he did not obey the wishes of parents, went to the British Postgraduate Art. In 1812, during the war, his stay in the United Kingdom, comfortable days, the war seems to be a not impede anyone&#39;s thing. After returning home, he as an artist get a fairly good reputation, but not rich. <br> Morse (a stubbornly anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant groups) into the party as a local American politicians, but he is very successful. <br> in the 1830s, due to the voyage by the same boat passengers Jackson infection, Morse began to keen on the electrical experiments. He decided to make a motor, but feel competent force, because he knew nothing of the knowledge of electricity. Once, he accidentally met Henry, Henry unstinting help him, answered all his questions. Since then, Morse began to seek assistance for the manufacture of the telegraph, Morse as a sustained decision Xi decisive display his true talent. <br> 1840, he made the patent, then he was trying to persuade, and persuasion hold very reluctantly approved by the Congress of the attitude of thirty thousand U.S. dollars in 1843, the annual appropriation Mount erected one from Seoul to Washington over forty miles of telegraph line (only more than six votes). In 1844, the telegraph line began to build, the same year the operators. Morse&#39;s first telegraph message was \"created by God what a miracle! \"The message so far is still any point known as the\" Morse code \"Morse invented the program telegraph symbol issued. <br> Morse continues to expose the despicable soul, because he never recognized Henry for his help, of course, when he was with Henry about the long-term invention priority during the proceedings, he was trying to adhere to Henry never help him. However, Henry testify in the trial, and easy to prove the opposite. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> during the Civil War, Morse is from the north, but because of his racist stance, that the blacks by slavery status is a matter of course, he sympathized with the South. Nevertheless, in his life, reputation, honor or followed. Memorial in the U.S. He went to great opening for the first time in 1900 at the New York University campus, Morse was the first batch of members, real great Americans Henry in 1915 was elected to. <br> thousands of years, communications technology has long-term stagnation. Even foreign invasion, the border town emergency Apart from smoke signals alarm, the quickest way, but the inn Kuaima transfer instrument. The mid-17th century, the British Navy in the implementation of the semaphore, the end of the 18th century, the French government established signal system, this solve the difficulties of the land and sea to quickly send a message to a certain extent. [L $ dj而.身r阱] <br> communications technology critical change occurred in the mid-19th century. autumn <br> 1832, a Post on board sailing in the Atlantic Ocean, to the passengers, American doctors Jackson speak electromagnet principle, travelers in the United States, 41-year-old painter Morse was captivated, and bearing in mind live. Lenovo him what he saw from the French signal system, every time it could only vision clinics and Communications miles; if the current transmission of electromagnetic signals, it is not possible in the moment messaging thousands of miles away? From that point on, he decided diverted engaged in the field of study of electricity. <br> Morse was born in 1791 in a family pastor in the United States. Study of painting and sculpture in his youth, served over a number of arts organizations responsible for duties. He swore off the road covered with the Honor carpet art, steering is still in the the juvenile era of electricity, and the risk of failure in efforts to climb the peak of rugged technology. In the trial of the telegraph, Morse&#39;s life is extremely hard sometimes starve. He lives frugally, for the purchase of Experimental equipment. In 1836, he had to re-artist-speaking old industry to solve the problem of livelihood. But he never interrupt the research work. Persistent efforts and the help of friends, Morse finally been successful. <br> Morse sudden cut-off from the flow of current in the wires in the wire Sparks were the fact that to be inspired, \"whimsical\" want, if the current cut-off as a signal that the current moment sparking on and no spark as another signal, the current is turned on longer, but also as a signal, these three signals are combined, it can represent all the letters and numbers, text can be far away by the current in the wires to the Office. pondering <br> After a few years, in 1837, Morse devised a well-known and simple codes, known as Morse code, it is the use of \"point\", \"plan\" and \"interval (in fact, different combinations of varying duration of the electrical pulse signal) to represent letters, numbers, punctuation and symbols. 24, May <br> 1844 in the Supreme Court Chamber of the Capitol in Washington, a group of scientists and government officials attentively watching Morse, I saw his hands manipulating the telegraph, with a series of & ldquo ; Point \",\" plan \", the signal received by the\" tick \"issue, as far away as 64 kilometers outside the city of Baltimore, the world&#39;s first\" despair \"sound consisting of a telegram. The first telegram <br> Bible verse: \"God created what a miracle\". <br> telegraph both manual and automatic, wired transmission and wireless transmission of two ways. Artificial telegraph from person to press the key, the key contacts open and close, and the formation of \"point\", \"plan\" and \"interval\" signal circuit transmission went out, closing newspapers received such an electrical signal after, they control the audio oscillator generates a \"tick\", \"despair\" sound \"beep\" sound for the \"point\", \"despair\" sound for the \"Plan for closed members listen to send a copy. <br> In the case of wireless communication, hair newspapers except for transmitting key, must also have a transmitter so that the key issued by the electric pulse signal conversion (i.e. modulation) into a high-frequency carrier signal, can be sent. At the receiving end, in addition to the headphones, but also must have a receiver, it receives the high frequency carrier signal transmitted by the transmitting side down, and then to transform (i.e., demodulated) into an audio signal, for aural send a copy. the automatic telegraph of <br> hair newspapers in transmitters in advance and will be ready to send the message dedicated perforator hewn Send perforated paper tape, then sent fast machine. In closing newspapers, using closed siphon recorder that automatically recorded on a moving tape corrugated signal in Morse code. <br> invention of the telegraph for meteorological data around quickly pass and centralized, so possible to draw day weather charts. <br> Morse (1892 ~ 1977) Morse, Harold Marston <br> American mathematician. Born March 24, 1892, in Waterville, Maine, June 22, 1977 and died in Princeton. He graduated from Colby College in 1914. Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1917. Serving in the American Expeditionary Force in World War I, from 1920 to 1934 worked at Cornell University, Brown University, Harvard University, 1935, he was appointed professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he retired in 1962. In 1932, he was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. 1964 National Medal of Science. Morse inherited of GD Birkhoff work on the dynamics, the 1925 promotion Minimax principle, first draw Morse inequalities, after the formation of the Morse theory. This theory is a combination of the topology and analysis, be the beginning of a large-scale analysis. Morse also have flow dynamics and other mathematicians cooperation research and geodetic minimal surfaces and the topology of the single complex function theory, integral representation, the pseudo harmonic functions and differential topology. Since the 1970s, based on Morse critical point theory work has played an important role in the study of partial differential equations. <br>'
