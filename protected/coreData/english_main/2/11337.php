'cont'=>'December 2, 1942 (, Imo October 25), the successful atomic fission. The Fermi <br> scientists armed with an atomic model <br> 1942 12 AH-Compton led by the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, for the first time made a controlled nuclei chain reaction opened the way for the atomic bomb and nuclear energy. the <br> scientists at the University of Chicago on the tennis court built a uranium and graphite nuclear reactor. 15:45 crucial moment arrived. When the lever away from neutrons produced in the fission of uranium atoms hit other atoms in the chain reaction can be sustained. Atomic reactor is part of the Manhattan manufacture an atomic bomb secrets. <br> Manhattan Project is implemented by the U.S. government in June 1942 aimed at the nuclear fission process to manufacture the atomic bomb project. By the summer of 1945, scientists and engineers to participate in the Manhattan Project developed an experimental atomic bomb. At this time, the funding provided by the Government for the Manhattan Project was increased by $ 60 million to $ 2 billion. <br>'
