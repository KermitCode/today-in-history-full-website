'cont'=>'May 2, 1980 (March 18) Gengshen of sheep frozen embryo transfer success. transplant trial <br> sheep frozen embryos by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, May 2, 1980, the first child by abdominal pregnancy \"lamb, a viviparous lamb, all of them developed normally. mother and sheep robust peace. <br> Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1979 Sheep as experimental animals, livestock ewes embryo cryopreservation. Donor ewe (supplied embryonic) first pituitary hormone treated ewes superovulation, to get more embryos. The sixth day after estrus and mating to the eighth day surgery to remove the embryos frozen before treatment with culture medium containing antifreeze agents. The embryos according to a certain cooling process, the slow freezing until the negative 60 ¡ã C, and then placed in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 ¡æ saved. Before the transplantation of the frozen embryos thawed and then a certain temperature program. This test will exceed 3 embryo cryopreservation 14 days after thawing moved into recipient ewes (to accept embryo, instead of the donor who are pregnant) uterus by abdominal pregnancy, the development of a three lambs. The success of the long-term preservation of embryo cryopreservation, embryo transfer technology is a major breakthrough, easy to expand the use of embryo transfer technology. Embryo cryopreservation technology is saving the cost of livestock feeding tube reserve the genetic material, the only reliable way to establish national long-term preservation of the gene pool breeds of livestock resources.
