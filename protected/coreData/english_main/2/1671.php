The driver Andrea - Di Erka meet at a maximum speed of 300 miles per hour. <br> France, Britain, the two sides eventually want the the Concorde to double the speed of sound with 3.5 hours across the Atlantic. The various airlines Concorde take a wait-and-see attitude. The original budget of $ 500,000,000 for the development of this aircraft, now costs 4 times more than the original budget.
