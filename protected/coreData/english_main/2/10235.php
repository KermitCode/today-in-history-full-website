(TodayinHistory.cn) <br> Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out that a variety of revolutionary history. However, in the past a revolution, not with the October Socialist Revolution comparable to. The establishment of a no exploitation of human society, was once the world dream of working people and progressive mankind for thousands of years. The October Revolution was the first time in the sixth of the world&#39;s land, this dream into a reality. This the revolution proved: the landowners and the bourgeoisie, the people are fully able to build a new life of freedom and happiness. At the same time prove: imperialist oppression, the nations of the world is completely able to live in harmony. In 40 years, the Soviet people experienced the hard way. The imperialists do everything possible to attempt to wipe out the world&#39;s first socialist Republic. The enemies of the Soviet Union once seems seems more powerful than the Soviet Union, them two armed attack on the Soviet Union. But heroic Soviet people, under the glorious leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, these invaders attack completely shattered. Mao Zedong Chairman <br> said, It is evident that after the October Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries of all countries ignore or do not seriously study the experience of the Russian revolution, not seriously study the experience of the Soviet dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist construction, and in accordance with specific national conditions, analysis and creative use of these experiences, then, he was not familiar with the new stage of development as Marxism-Leninism, will not be able to correctly solve the problem of the country&#39;s revolution and construction. Then, he will, or fall into the error of dogmatism, or fall into the error of revisionism. We need to oppose two erroneous tendencies, at present, against revisionism tendency is especially urgent task. The socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system, which is the objective law of a transfer to one&#39;s own will. However much the reactionaries attempt to stop the wheel of history, sooner or later revolution will take place and will inevitably triumph. <br> Chairman Mao Zedong, the situation in China: a vigorous rectification movement on in a more solid foundation for the rapid development of China&#39;s socialist cause, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist. This is the problem in urban and rural areas for the two roads of socialism and capitalism, the fundamental system of the country and major policies, the work style of the Party and government staff, the people&#39;s life and welfare items, with facts and reason, free to expand its leadership debate people to correctly solve the actual existence among the people for the current necessary to solve the contradiction problem. This is a socialist people&#39;s movement of self-education, self-transformation. This movement has achieved a huge victory. Those who do so place, the people&#39;s socialist consciousness and rapid growth, the erroneous ideas quickly clarify the shortcomings in the work quickly overcome the rapid strengthening of the unity of the people, the rapid increase of labor discipline and labor productivity. We are a population of 600 million, by stages, the implementation of the people&#39;s self-education movement, probably another few months nationwide victory. In future, we prepare an annual or biannual basis rectification movement, exercise time can be greatly shortened, as a major way to resolve social conflicts throughout our transition. A fundamental starting point for the implementation of this method is the need to firmly believe that the majority of the masses will stand on our side, reason. This point has been proved by the movement of all experience. <br> Chairman Mao Zedong emphasized, according to Lenin&#39;s principle of close ties with the masses, and to recognize the initiative of the masses, the implementation of criticism and self-criticism, in the years of revolutionary practice, drawn Rectification method socialist self education campaigns once again illustrates the correctness of this method. Marx in the Declaration of the Establishment of the International Workers Association, said: \"The past experience has shown: ignore the existence of fraternal solidarity among workers of all countries should, to neglect this should encourage them firmly fought side by side in the liberation struggle of the fraternal solidarity, it will make They dispersed efforts was a common failure. \"90 years ago, Marx instructions we will never become obsolete. <br> 11, 21, Chairman Mao Zedong led the Chinese delegation returned to Beijing. <br> Mao Zedong in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to celebrate the October Revolution 40th anniversary meeting speech <br> the Mao Zedong signed the Moscow meeting by the Communist Party, the socialist countries, and the Workers&#39; Party Declaration < ; br>'
