'cont'=>'(Bingyin July 28), September 2, 1986, Deng Xiaoping accept Wallace TV interview to talk about the Soviet Union, China-US relations. Reference September 1986, Deng Xiaoping, director of the Central Advisory Committee, told the CBS \"60 Minutes\" program reporter Wallace TV interview to talk about the Sino-Soviet relations, Sino-US relations, China unity and domestic situation. <br> on Sino-Soviet relations, Deng Xiaoping said, Gorbachev&#39;s speech in Vladivostok, a little something new, but the pace is not large. China policy within the Soviet Union would happen, we have to observe. And the Soviet Union actually is hot and confrontation, however, the way of confrontation with China by the Vietnamese army. (History today www.lssdjt.com) If the Soviet Union could help the Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia, I am willing to meet with Gorbachev. I believe this to meet the normalization of great significance to improve Sino-Soviet relations, the Sino-Soviet state-to-state relations. <br> about Sino-US relations, (Lssdjt.com) Deng Xiaoping said, the obstacle in Sino-US relations is the Taiwan issue. Hope that during the administration of President Ronald Reagan to be further development of Sino-US relations, which include the United States can make a difference in the unification of China. <br> about the unification of China, Deng Xiaoping said that all Chinese people are unified China, we have taken the way of the \"one country, two systems\" to resolve the question of reunification, there is no loss to the people of Taiwan. <br> domestic situation, Deng Xiaoping said, the principles of socialism, the first is the development of production; common prosperity. China&#39;s policy does not lead to polarization, China&#39;s policy is not going to change, the people think that the current policy is correct, and who want to change the current policy, who must be overthrown. <br>'
