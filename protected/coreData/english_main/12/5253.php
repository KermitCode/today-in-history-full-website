'cont'=>'In (Yi Chou, April 24), June 12, 1985, death of mathematician Hua. the death of the <br> mathematician Hua \"target =\" _blank \"> Hua Luogeng <br> 1974, mathematician Hua (left) in rural areas to promote the preferred method < br> 1985, June 12, at 4:00 pm, the fame of the math superstar Professor Hua hale and hearty and in the University of Tokyo on the podium and he is the invitation of the Japanese mathematical community for a number of individuals \"in the the universal mathematical methods in China experience academic speech. 75-year-old Chinese old began speaking in Chinese, translated into Japanese by a translator. Later Chinese old consent participants agreed to switch to English speaking meeting atmosphere suddenly active rapport together, the audience reacted strongly bad. Hua old legs, usually walking with a cane, Japanese friends for his wheelchair, he Hinco intended to concentrated almost been standing there speaking to a blackboard before about a foot high platform, even miraculously zoned zoned write on the blackboard China Lawas speak emotionally higher even took off his coat, undid his tie, holding forth he speaks vivid, concise, witty, (L $ djτ.cōm) from time to time win the Japanese colleagues laughter and applause 45 minutes of the scheduled report time passed quickly, the old Chinese Introduction yet been finalized best breath about 20 minutes. Chinese old After the speech, he tried to stand up from the wheelchair to express my gratitude to , - the acute myocardial Paul plug, the presence of a doctor immediately for emergency treatment, every effort, however, to no avail. the 1924 annuity altar junior high school graduation, after hard self-study in 1930 to teach at Tsinghua University. suddenly fell to the ground in 1936 went to the University of Cambridge visit learning. return home in 1938, he served as professor at the Southwest Associated University. went to the United States in 1946, he served as the researcher of the Institute of Mathematics of Princeton, Princeton University and the University of Illinois professor, returning in 1950. served as a professor at Tsinghua University, [τōdāyōhī $ τōry.cōm] foreign academician of Academy of Sciences, Institute of Mathematics and director of the Institute of Applied Mathematics, honorary director, chairman of the China Mathematical Society, honorary chairman of the National Mathematics Competition Committee Officer, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Third World Academy of Sciences, Fellow of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences of the Federal Republic of Germany, physics mathematics chemistry, deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Vice President, members of the Bureau, Head of the Department of Mathematics, University of Science and Technology of China, Vice-Chancellor, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, a member of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council and other staff. served up to the Sixth NPC Standing Committee , sixth, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference. was awarded an honorary doctorate of the University of Nancy, France, Hong Kong Chinese University and the University of Illinois in the United States. mainly engaged in analytic number theory, matrix geometry typical group, automorphic function theory, several complex variables. the field of research and professor of the theory of partial differential equations, high-dimensional numerical integration work and outstanding achievements. 1940s to solve the Gaussian complete the triangle to estimate the historical problems, the best order of error estimate (this results in number theory has a wide range of applications); made significant improvements of the G.H. Thomas Hardy and J.E. 李特尔伍德 Waring problem and E. Wright about the the Taree problem results, is still the best record. proven history of long-term legacy of the one-dimensional projective geometry Fundamental Theorem of algebra; given the body&#39;s normal subgroup must contain among its center the result of a simple and direct proof is called Cartan - cloth Rao Seoul - China theorem. monograph Additive Theory of Primes \"summarized the development and improved the Hardy 李特尔伍德 circle method Vinogradov and Triangle estimation method and his method, published more than 40 years to its main results continued to hold the world leader, has been translated into Russian, Hungary, Japan, Germany, published in English, the writings of one of the 20th century classical number theory. monograph harmonic analysis on more complex variable typical domain \"precision analysis and matrix techniques, combined with group representation theory, complete orthogonal system gives the typical domain specific, Cauchy and Poisson&#39;s nuclear expression of this work in harmonic analysis, complex analysis, differential equations, etc. have extensive and in-depth research, won the First Prize of Natural Science. advocated the development of applied mathematics and computer, has published the \"integrated approach Pinghua\" preferred, \"and many other writings and in the promotion and application of China and Wang collaboration with Professor Yuan was important achievements of modern number theory applied research, known as the \"China - Wang method has made important contributions in the development of mathematics education and science popularization. published more than 200 research papers and monographs and popular science book dozens. return home in 1950, he served as a professor at Tsinghua University, director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Applied Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Faculty Director, Vice-President and Head of the Department of Mathematics, University of Science and Technology of China, Vice-Chancellor, etc. grade in algebra, geometry, several complex variable function, number theory, and other fields have made an outstanding contribution to his cooperation with Wang Yuan Modern number theory research applications in the approximate analysis of the results to be known as \"China - - Wang method in the research and teaching work, his attention to the theory with practice, emphasis on the application of mathematical methods in industrial and agricultural production, a lot of work for the promotion of co-ordination Act and the preferred method. academic works: \"Stackable primes theory \", Mathematical Introduction,\" typical group \",\" Higher Mathematics An Introduction (Volume 1), \"Number Theory guide\", \"preferred method\", the integrated approach Pinghua \"mathematical induction\". ( lifetime total Lssdjt.com) Hua published about 200 papers, 10 monographs, eight of them translated and published abroad, some included in this century classics. Hua is the history of the American Academy of elected as a foreign academician of the Chinese people, his name is listed as the Chicago Museum of Science and Technology, today 88 mathematics one of the greats of the international mathematical community recognized that he is \"absolutely first-class mathematician. <br> < ; br> Hua <br>'
