The second phase of the negotiations <br> <br>: July 12, 1983, the Sino-British negotiations on the second phase of the future of Hong Kong was held in Beijing. This stage of negotiations that lasted 14 months, and held a total of 22. <br> negotiations began, the British insist on sovereignty and separation of the right to rule \"stance, namely,\" the principle of recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain in general as in the past the administration of Hong Kong \". China insisted the position of the sovereign and inalienable right to rule, that in 1997, China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, including the exercise of executive powers, including the complete sovereignty, rather than a mere figurehead nominally \"sovereign & rdquo ;. 3 negotiations basically said each their own, no progress was made.
