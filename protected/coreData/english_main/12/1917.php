'cont'=>'February 12, 2001, the first month on the 20th (Government House), the scientists first published the human genome. <br> 2006 11 24, the international team of scientists announced the new the human genome <br> 2001 February 12, 2010, by scientists from six countries to participate in the international human genome published human genome and a preliminary analysis of the results. This research project, known as the Life Sciences moon program made significant progress in laying a solid foundation for humanity to uncover their own mysteries. The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and China took part in the human genome international cooperation on large-scale sequencing of the 23 pairs of chromosomes, DNA, and eventually draw a precise map of the human genome, a similar chemical periodic table. <br> scientists after preliminary interpretation contains more than 30,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. The Human Genome implies genetic information of human illness and death, to decipher it will bring revolutionary advances in disease diagnosis, new drug development and exploration of new therapies. The goal of the Human Genome Project by the determination of the entire sequence of the human genome, and interpretation of all the genetic information, to clarify the structure and function of the human genome and all of its genes, to uncover the mysteries of life. However, the life sciences sector has been dense fog, humanity will take some time to read \"Life bible, a long way to go. (History today www.lssdjt.com) <br>'
