'cont'=>'December 12, 2010 (GY winter in early VII), and put into use in China&#39;s first deep underground laboratory will study dark matter. <br> computer simulation maps of dark matter. The illustration shows the invisible dark matter \"target =\" _blank \"> dark matter is how in halo combination of <br> of China&#39;s first deep underground laboratory -\" China Jinping Underground Laboratory \"today Jinping Hydropower Station in Sichuan inaugurated and put into use, Jinping Underground Laboratory vertical rock coverage up to 2400 meters, is the world rock covering most laboratory it marks the completion of China already has the world-class clean low radiation research platform able to independently carry out basic research topics like international forefront of this dark matter detection., dark matter detector of the experimental group, Tsinghua University has taken the lead into the lab and start probing work, and next year the Shanghai Jiaotong University and other research team will also enter here carrying out the detection of dark matter research. <br> Pictured \"China Jinping Underground Laboratory\" for dark matter detection of ultra-low energy valve the HPGe detector <br> nouns explained: dark matter <br> the in cosmology, dark matter refers to material that does not emit any light and electromagnetic radiation. (history. cn) people are currently only produced by the gravitational effect that in the presence of a large number of dark matter in the universe. earliest evidence for the existence of dark matter derived from observations of the spherical galaxy rotation speed of modern astronomy by gravitational lensing, the formation of large-scale structure in the universe, the microwave background radiation, and other studies have shown: the universe part of our present knowledge only about 4% of the dark matter to account for the universe 23%, 73% is a cause of dark energy accelerating expansion of the universe. <br> underground laboratory in the tunnel <br> in the process of construction of Ertan Hydropower Station, Sichuan Jinpingshan end had built 18 km automobile traffic tunnel, the above is over 2500 m thick mountain rock here will be the first experiment to carry out ground after the establishment of the Institute, specifically \"manhunt\" dark matter here is the environment of the world&#39;s most superior detection of dark matter. < br> It is called the best quarter east of the Director of National Chiao Tung University, Department of Physics, particle physics, cosmology, director of the Institute, the laboratory use of local repair of underground tunnels built hydropower in its side of the excavation is 40 meters long width, height 6 m space thus with some foreign \"bodiless\" compared to mine underground laboratory, the use of more convenient elevator up and down, do not have to sit and ride car can \"into the earth . \"depth of 2500 m tunnel is rare, because buried deeper, cosmic rays, the less interference <br>\" underground work \"no discomfort <br>\" from the ground on the car for about 20 minutes, will be able to reach the underground laboratory. \"special researcher of the Institute of National Chiao Tung University particle physics cosmology Ni Triumph remember the feeling of the first into the ground\". wear a helmet, wearing hard-soled shoes. into the lab, pleasant to the eye is a variety of equipment. \"where the seasonal temperature, cool in summer and warm in winter, do not need air conditioning. uniquely different laboratory with the ground, there are no windows, rain and wind have no sense, go for a long time is also easy to be confusing the outside world, day or night. \"<br>\" underground work \"a long time, whether there will be discomfort?\" good ventilation of the underground laboratory, did not Feeling of tightness, stay below a half a day, does not have any strange feeling. \"Ni Triumph Once the instrument is running stable, he simply monitoring probes can be run in the office on the ground, and underground experiments room of all data will be transmitted to the ground, thus, researchers do not need 24 hours \"Code\" detector. <br>'
