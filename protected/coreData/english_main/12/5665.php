It turned out that a coup is in Big Boss Prince joint Nakatomi Kamatari human reform. <br> Soga into the deer killed <br> to Japan by several large islands and several islets countries. In ancient times, one of the characteristics of this island is to solve their own internal contradictions must, difficult to interference by external forces, the biggest obstacle to the sea, then people exchanges with the outside world, so own reform is extremely necessary. After the 3rd century AD, Japan&#39;s Honshu region a larger regime - Japanese country. Japan the country originally limited to the central Japan region of Honshu Island. In constant expansion, Japan country gradually occupied the neighboring regions, growing territory. 5th century, this country has been unified most of today&#39;s Japan is developed on this basis. Japanese national supreme ruler Emperor. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> Japanese national in the expansion process, and continuously occupy the surrounding land and the people of the land, and assign it to the members of the royal family and nobility. Japanese national land is divided into two parts Miyake and Grange, the former belongs to the royal family, which belongs to the aristocracy. Working people is divided into two parts, a small portion of slaves, mainly used for domestic labor, another part of the Ministry of China, is mainly used in the production of labor. Ministry of China is a special phenomenon in the Japanese state formation process. Out to conquer the Japanese national allegiance of tribes and conquered tribal collective settling down to retain the original tribal organizations, continue to live on the original land, many still retains its original kinship; addition There are also specialized in the professional production department, its workers, also known as the Ministry of China. Accordance with the classification, called Tabe engaged in agricultural production, rice, and works in the general term for the handicraft industry or other industries engaged in the production unit within the Ministry of goods in accordance with the different industry divided into clothes sewing section, blacksmiths Ministry.

The owners are not free to kill or trading Ministry of China, but you can treat the slaves like them as a gift for others. Ministry people and slaves are not very different. At the time, the Ministry people and accounts for more than half of Japan&#39;s population slaves. Between the nobility and the Ministry of China is a large number of civilians, and their status is changing due to changes in the property, the moment the risk of becoming Ministry of China. Basically unified the country after the Japanese state has lost the continued expansion of the geographical environment, the internal start the contention. The large aristocratic strongly want exclusive control of the central regime, derive greater benefits. Before the 6th century, the powerful Monobe&#39;s control of the affairs of state.

The Soga clan arrogant, small nobility also crazy following annexation of land, the brutal exploitation of the Ministry of China, the land of many civilians were also deprived of land and wealth continue to focus on the unprecedented sharp social contradictions. In this case, the slave, the Ministry of public and civilians have revolted, refusal to pay taxes to flee. In the 6th century, the society as a whole has been in disarray.

Later, he tried a preparation of the way of household registration, and achieved good results, the Ministry of China rarely escape. This approach has been the reward of the Emperor. Adopted to establish the way of household registration, small producers in the past, part of the Tabe China enslaved into the household as a unit. These small producers directly to the state to pay an annual tribute, actually became a free country farmers. But reform advocates have been stubborn forces of opposition in court.
