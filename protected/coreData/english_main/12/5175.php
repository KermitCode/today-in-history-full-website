'cont'=>'June 12, 1944 (April 22) Jiashen leap, the world&#39;s first missile V-1 was put into actual combat. In In 1944, the world&#39;s first missile by the German Research --- V-1 missile was put into actual combat. The intermittent jet engine was pioneered in 1928 by Paul - Schmidt AS 109-014 engine eventually able to come out. This engine is used as Fi 103 (also known as V-1 or FZG 76) propeller. This is first put into practical use cruise missiles. Fi 103 is a small aircraft has a wingspan depending Model 5.3 m or 4.87 m, driven by an intermittent jet engines. In order to achieve the operating speed of the engine, the Fi 103 by a long bevel launchers or aircraft carrying launch routes controlled by the compass, the distance flown by a small propeller-conditioning. Flew over the target, the V-1 changed to a sharp dive flight. This will result in the acceleration process thruster downtime. This attack effect later V-1 have been modified to prevent this from happening. V-1 flying height is relatively low, the speed is not fast enough the fastest Allied fighters will be able to intercept it, therefore its effective defense is entirely possible. London 2418 V-1 hit, fall 2448 in Antwerp. This design <br> simple and inexpensive weapon is the all cruise missiles predecessor. It must be launched by a long bevel launchers, to speed to reach the the intermittent jet engine began work requirements. Subsequently, the V-1, 3 SUMMARY gyroscope guided, in the 2000-3000 feet altitude. Fly set voyage, the engine shut down, missile dive, an instant before touchdown explosion. <br> V-1 missile parameters: Model: medium-range cruise missiles, the country of manufacture: German wing width: 17 feet inside width of 7.5 ft (5.37 m) Length: 25 feet, where 11 feet long (7.9 meters ) Height: 4 feet, (lssjt.cn) high 77/8 feet (1.42 m) Weight: 2152 kg engine: 1 Argus As 109-014 pusher thrust: 300 kg of propellant: 568 liters of 80 octane the general flying height of the high-speed :390-410 miles / hour (624-656 km / h): 2500 ft (760 m) maximum altitude: 10,000 feet (3050 meters) Range: 150 miles (240 km) flight time: 2 hours and 30 seconds warhead: 830 000 Kee Ma Figure explosives <br> the the'
