The planet around 24 A light year away from Earth faint stellar 范比斯布罗克 eighteen operation. According to reports, the newly discovered planet and the distance between eighteen 范比斯布罗克, roughly equivalent to the distance between the Sun and Jupiter. <br> astronomers Fengyun newly discovered planetary surface temperature degrees Celsius, one thousand and ninety-three heat than any planet in our solar system, but too dark, too cold, so it can not be the star.
