'cont'=>'April 12, 1981 (, yau March eighth day), the U.S. space shuttle \"Columbia\" was launched. <br> United States successfully launched the world&#39;s first space shuttle \"Columbia\" <br> 1981 am local time, 7 o&#39;clock (GMT 20:00), [lsjt.net] U.S. space shuttle \"Columbia\" was launched into space at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch, I saw the tail of the \"Columbia\" send a raging flame, emitting clouds of gray-white, then it soar. The long, white smoke has been stretched to the sky. After more than two minutes, the solid fuel booster rocket from the space shuttle, to the ocean splashed down 250 kilometers away from the launch site. Flight test is normal. <br> \"Columbia\" was the first test flight crew commander John Young and pilot Robert Crippen. Astronaut John Young has been driving the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft the four into space, while Robert Crippen into space the first time. The space shuttle main orbiter, booster rockets and propellants external tank three main parts. The orbiter is the main part of the space shuttle can be manned and payload. About 37 meters, maximum wingspan of 24 meters. Weight of about 68 tons. The United States in 1972, decided to develop the space shuttle. Designed to use it to put a lot of load into Earth orbit, so that it can repair a satellite in orbit, and can satellite back to earth repair. It can be like an airplane landing on the runway of the airport, and can be reused 100 times. However, the purpose of the \"Columbia\" just to test its performance. This time, the first four test flights of the plan to 1982, was officially sailing. <br> on the development of science and technology and political, which are a cause notable event in the world, already has made significant progress since the 1957 Sputnik God, the world and Astronautical Science, the present air does not stop the operation of a variety of satellites countless. However, they can only be themselves falling into ruin can not be repaired, re-use and can not return to Earth. \"The design of the space shuttle Columbia, precisely in order to solve this problem. It can fly like a rocket to run like satellite orbit like a glider landed on time, and then can be used again. 18 meters long cabin, the shipment of 36 tons of goods. In other words, the space shuttle if successful, will be used as working in space science laboratory, opened up a new source of knowledge for mankind. After a while, even to become an air plant on the ground is difficult to produce high standard products. Can also become space repair station, manned and equipped to build a new satellite, maintenance or withdrawal of the old satellite. Was the space shuttle called \"space truck\", may regularly and from the mid-1980s to between Earth and space. the <br> first manned space shuttle and return to the ground the repeated use of the space shuttle \"Columbia\", a speed of 17,500 miles per hour around the earth 36 laps after 54 hours in April scheduled to fly back to Edwards Air Force Base in California on the afternoon of the 14th. <br>'
