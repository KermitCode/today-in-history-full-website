'cont'=>'(Guihai March 22), May 12, 1803, the birthday of German chemist Liebig. Justus, <br>, Von Lee Liebig (1803-1873) the famous German chemist. May 12, 1803 Born in Darmstadt, Germany Leeson. His father is a business inorganic salts and pigments businessman, his spare time on these things to engage in chemical experiments (l $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) Liebig&#39;s Birthday \"target The =\" _blank \"> Liebig small collar into the field of chemistry doctorate from the University of Erlangen in 1822 and in Paris in 1824 to complete a series of fulminate compounds. returning from Paris served as a professor of chemistry at the University of Giessen, immediately embarked on an unheard-of plan, ( TodayinHistory.cn) that is to reform the traditional German chemical education system and teaching methods, and explore methods of creating a new generation of chemists. Liebig preparation for laboratory teaching a new syllabus, which states: start, while students in learning handouts we need to do the experiment, the first use of a known compound for qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis, and purification from natural substances and the identification of new compounds and inorganic synthesis and organic synthesis; After completion of the course, independent research under the guidance of an instructor Finally, through the identification as a thesis project; Ph.D. Liebig such students in the lab from the system training gradually transferred to an independent study of the teaching system, he has not previously been aware of modern chemical education system laid the foundation. <br> Giessen laboratory created, chemistry syllabus preparation and Liebig dedication and rigorous scholarship, chemical education campaigns in Germany than in any other place more momentum and more far-reaching impact of development owners gathered in the University of Giessen, Liebig sects in order to attract students from far and wide. trained through the system in the laboratory under the careful guidance of Liebig, train a large number of world-famous chemist. including top promising dye chemistry Hoffman, the foundation and the dye industry alkyl halide and sodium metal prepared hydrocarbon Wu Tsz proposed benzene ring structure doctrine to lay a solid foundation for the organic structure theory known as \"Chemical architect Kekule was Mendeleev as the \"father of Russian chemist\" Wo Sike column Mr. Sharansky. worth pointing out that these students still in the country to follow the example of Giessen practice, the establishment of a number of student-oriented teaching laboratory, the the Giessen chemical education model to be actively promoted in the world, and nurtured many famous chemist, (TodayinHistory.cn) formed Giessen Liebig School, made a great contribution to the development of the world&#39;s chemical. (TodayinHistory.cn basic chemical principles) <br> made many significant contributions to the late turned to the study of biochemistry and agricultural chemistry. biochemistry and agricultural chemical (history. cn) Liebig studied fermentation and corruption chemical principles applied to chemical agriculture production, put forward the theory of mineral nutrition of plants, determined to restore soil fertility fertilization chemical principles, promoting the use of inorganic fertilizers to complement the other elements in the soil may be depleted. <br>'
