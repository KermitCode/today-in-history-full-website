'cont'=>'January 5, 1896 (Yi Wei in the winter months, twenty), X-ray made public. The 1896 1 <br> X-ray <br> exhibited Physical Society meeting in Berlin on a lot of X-ray photos, the same day, the Vienna Business News \"also reported the discovery of X-rays message. This great discovery immediately aroused great attention, and soon spread all over the world. Hundreds of scientists for this research in a few months time, the year when there are thousands of articles on the X-ray papers come out. <br> X-ray is the German physicist Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered by chance when doing a test. Roentgen was born in 1845 Germany lennep. In 1869, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Zurich. After 19 years, he worked at the university, won the outstanding reputation of the scientists. In 1888, Roentgen professor and dean of the School of Physics of the University of W¨¹rzburg. <br> 1895, Roentgen, as usual, had lunch and then got into the lab, tinkering with the most peculiar optical instruments - vacuum Crooks - the Hittorf pipe. \" Evening, to study its cathode ray when he again then generic black wrap tube power, stumbled upon a light about two meters away from the stool. The original, there stood a do another experiment with cardboard coated with platinum cyanide barium (a fluorescent substance). He felt very strange, is what makes this Cardboard is not as light emitting? His keen guessed, is likely the cardboard tube emitted a certain \"something\" to reach, the platinum cyanide barium luminous, but will not is a cathode ray tube, because it can penetrate only a few centimeters of air. He turn off the power, then the light disappeared, so repeated several times, confirmed his guess. Uncertain due to the nature of the \"things\" issued by the tube, Roentgen put this phenomenon named \"X-ray - X is usually unknown mathematical symbols. January 23, 1896, Kerry Kerr, professor of the University of Wurzburg, \"X-ray\" for \"X-rays\". Found one to change the face of the world was born. <br> by this accidental discovery of incentive to put down other research projects Roentgen to concentrate energy survey of X-ray characteristics. The study, he found: X-ray to make many substances luminous; X-rays can penetrate opaque substances, In particular, he noted that X-rays can through his flesh, just bones resistance, put his hand on the cathode ray tube and between the phosphor screen, be able to see on the screen the shadow of Shougu; X-ray is a straight line, which charge particle beam, magnetic field refraction .... Finally, Roentgen experimental skills made nine X-ray the outcome of an important nature. This shows, Roentgen, not just a quick glance toward the fluorescent cardboard found the giant X-ray, but rely on keen observation, scientific foresight, sound judgment, and superb experimental force became a distinguished scientist. The first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901, when 17 of the 29 letters of recommendation, recommended him to focus. The roentgen eventually won the first Nobel prize. the <br> 1923 years, (lsjt.org) Roentgen in Munich, Germany, died at the age of 78. <br>'
