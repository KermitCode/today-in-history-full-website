'cont'=>'January 5, 2003, three days of the twelfth lunar month (Imo), the \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft successfully returned. In In January 2003 between days 19 and 16, the \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft after the completion of the the predetermined space science and technology test task, in the central region of Inner Mongolia accurate landing. At this point, the fourth flight test of China&#39;s manned space project was a complete success. On the evening of the 5th, when the \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft orbiting the earth 107 laps flew over the South Atlantic Ocean, the Yuanwang III space tracking ship on standby there to issue a return command. The spaceship immediately create a return gesture, the returning module and orbital module separated, braking engine ignition, began to return to the Earth&#39;s surface from space. Spacecraft enters the atmosphere, 80 kilometers away from the ground to about 8 kilometers per second high-speed flight, and the atmosphere intense friction return capsule surface plasma layer, the formation of electromagnetic shielding temporarily interrupt the contact with the ground. The Xi&#39;an Satellite Monitoring Center landing station the spaceship just flying out of the \"black area\", responsible for spacecraft recovery tasks in a timely manner found the target. After that, in accordance with a predetermined program, the spacecraft smooth field region in central Inner Mongolia spaceship landing field landing, search and rescue personnel to spacecraft return capsule recovery. the <br> \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft launch manned space launch site in Jiuquan in the early hours of December 30, 2002, 6 days and 18 hours in space flight scheduled 108 laps around the Earth. Return capsule shipped back to Beijing, technical analysis and scientific research by the research staff of the spacecraft and pilot projects. Spacecraft orbital module continued in orbit for the space science and application tests. the <br> \"Shenzhou IV spacecraft&#39;s successful launch and return, indicating that China&#39;s manned space engineering technology maturity, and laid a solid foundation for the eventual realization of manned flight. <br> <br>'
