'cont'=>'July 5, 1998 (Tiger years leap 12 May), the world&#39;s first cloned sheep was born. cloned two calves <br> <br> July 5, 1998, Japanese scientists announced that they cloned using somatic cells of adult animals two calves successfully born. Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan Livestock Center and Kinki University Animal Science Research Center announced the results pointed out that this two calves cell nuclear transfer technology with the cloning of Dolly the sheep was cloned successful. Researchers of the two institutions somatic cells taken from the inside of the fallopian tubes and uterus of adult female cattle, somatic nuclear five days of serum-free culture, transplant personnel go to In addition to the nuclear eggs, and then using the method of electrical stimulation promoting both fusion, and after eight days of in vitro culture, bred embryos. researchers <br> November 13 last year, 10 such embryos to two group were transplanted into five cows in utero. All five cows pregnant, including two twins. The birth of two cloned cattle oviduct cells cloned, they are born weighing 18.16 kg and 17.26 kg, respectively. The scientists have yet to name them. 4 (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) harbor cloned cattle cows scheduled for mid-August childbirth. The the <br> cloning of Dolly the sheep the birth of <br> compare last year cells cloned animals from the Roslin Institute, UK. The two head of cattle since July 5, 1996 Dolly the sheep after the birth of the first batch of successful cloning using somatic cells of adult animals animals. <br> the most recent year, a fierce debate on cloning technology has gradually reached a unanimous opinion. Many people think that cloning technology breakthrough is a major scientific and technological achievements, human like the use of other technologies as correct use of this technology, the ability to prevent it against humanity. In addition there is an urgent requirement of the international community to develop the relevant international law, to regulate the research and application of this technology, and make it to maximize the benefit of mankind. <br> British Committee on Science and Technology released a report in March last year, pointed out that, far as we know, cloning technology in at least five areas for the benefit of mankind: to promote human understanding of the biological mechanism of growth and development, especially factors affect the growth and aging; suitable organ transplants; mass production manufacturing of biological materials for certain drugs; provide more suitable animals for scientific experiments; cultivating superior varieties of livestock and poultry. <br> how to effectively prevent the risk of cloning technology to make it to maximize the benefit of mankind? Some experts believe that, at present, it is necessary to do this, the most important prerequisite for the international community to develop and perfect the relevant international law, develop their own corresponding legal States under international law, and establish institutions of all levels of clinical control. Earlier this year, an American scientist proposed human cloning plans was insight condemnation around the world. Human cloning technology within a few years it may look from the current level of technological development, the advent of the cloning of Dolly the chief scientist Ian - Wilmot. The animal <br> (lsjt.net) <br> cloning of Dolly the sheep became the world&#39;s most compelling'
