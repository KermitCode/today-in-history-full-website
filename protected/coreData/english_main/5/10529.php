'cont'=>'November 5, 1993 (September 22) πÔ”œ Eurocorps. <br> 1993, created by France, Germany and Belgium. Eurocorps General Staff Strasbourg in eastern France, officially proclaimed. Zhezhi unified European forces have a significant impact on the birth of the European defense and security, but also become the focus of world attention. <br> Europe With a unified command of the armed forces, which are both symbolic and political meaning, while also stepping up to play a practical role in European defense. At that time, the process of European integration is stepping up the European political union, make EC a difference in the European defense and security, entails one can command the armed forces fielding, until prior to the establishment of the European army throughout Europe no real power to only one of the Western European Union (WEU), the agency can only play a coordinating role in the national defense policy. The face of the turmoil in Europe, obviously can not contribute much. The establishment of the European army, at least make up for this gap. The Eurocorps plan made it clear that its mission is to act as the defense forces of the Western European Union (WEU), the event of a crisis, to participate in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations. (Lsjt.org) <br> Eurocorps responsible for the security of Europe before the establishment of the US-led NATO, therefore, the Eurocorps plans announced, it immediately sparked unrest and controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. France as early as 30 years ago, withdrew from NATO&#39;s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, the future has always advocated the independence of European defense, after the end of the Cold War, the more clearly the establishment of the Western European Union (WEU) as the main independent European defense system. The United States are extremely uneasy, worried that this would weaken the traditional position of NATO in European political and defense, which put pressure on France. In intra-EC countries due to their different interests and strategic considerations difference a mixed reaction to the French claim, can not agree. hesitation <br> held by the Western European countries is also a certain sense, then, both away from the Gulf War in Europe (on com) or within easy reach of the Bosnia conflict, if not the direct intervention of the United States, Western Europe&#39;s own strength is thin and it is difficult to make a difference. It can be said, NATO is still in a reliable security guarantee of the turmoil in Europe. Faced with this reality, the French government has made a corresponding adjustment of the policy, said the end of 1992, agreed to Eurocorps unified command of the NATO Supreme Allied Commander; early 1993, an agreement reached with NATO requirements, if there is a crisis, France in Eurocorps within troops will accept NATO&#39;s operational command, this agreement not only to determine the relationship between the two, and also that France still refuses, like other Western European countries, all the military power to NATO unique position. France only within a limited range of NATO made concessions. The Eurocorps establishment added to the complex and volatile situation in Europe more difficult to predict. <br>'
