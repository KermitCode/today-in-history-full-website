'cont'=>'October 5, 2010, August 28 (GY), graphene discoverers ÅµÎÖÐ¤Âå·ò the Anaheim won the Nobel Prize in Physics. In In 2010, October 5, 2010, (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the 2010 Nobel Physics Prize was awarded to the University of Manchester scientists Andre Anaheim and Constance Ding ÅµÎÖÐ¤Âå·ò, in recognition of their excellence in graphene materials. The Heim and ÅµÎÖÐ¤Âå·ò graphene material was made in 2004. This is the thinnest material in the world, only one atom thick. Since then, graphene is rapidly becoming a hot topic in physics and materials science. <br> Andre Anaheim, scientists from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom. 1958 10 born in Russia&#39;s southwestern city of Sochi. Received his Ph.D. in Solid State Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1987, had while employed by the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, is also a professor emeritus at the University of Delft, the Netherlands. Prior has received many honors and awards, and in 2000 he also won the \"Ig Nobel\" - gravity magnetic overcome, a frog suspended in mid-air. ¡¤ ÅµÎÖÐ¤Âå·ò <br> Constantine (Konstantin Novoselov), scientists from the University of Manchester, UK. Born in 1974 in Russia&#39;s Nizhny Tagil dual citizenship with the United Kingdom and Russia.ÅµÎÖÐ¤Âå·ò the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands received his Ph.D. in 2004. During the PhD he started with Andre Anaheim collaborative research. <br> two professors of winning, but also the University of Manchester, the existing number of Nobel Prize winners to four. \"This is really a good news. We are pleased that these two professors in graphene research has been the highest recognition of the Nobel Committee, \"Nancy Roswell, chancellor of the University of Manchester, said,\" This is another in the interest of the scientific and practical foundation made important discoveries example, their findings have important social and economic significance. \"<br> 2004, the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom Andre ¡¤ K ¡¤ Anaheim (Andre K. Geim) prepared graphene. Anaheim graphene and his colleagues accidentally discovered a simple new way. They forced separation of graphite into smaller fragments, stripped from the debris out of thin graphite flakes stuck on both sides of the sheet, and then use an ordinary plastic tape, tear tape, sheet also will be divided into two. Repeating this process, can be obtained increasingly thin graphite sheet (the theoretical thickness of only 0.34 nm graphene, about 1/200000 of the hair diameter), and wherein the portion of the sample constituted by only one carbon atom - they were prepared to graphene. <br> graphene, the thinnest material in the world let condensed matter physicists pleasantly surprised. Due to the strong force between the carbon atoms, even after repeated stripping, the crystal structure of graphene is still very much intact, which ensures that the electron energy in the graphene plane unimpeded migration, the migration rate for traditional semiconductor silicon material dozens supremacy hundredfold. This advantage makes graphene is likely to replace silicon as basic materials for the next generation of ultra-high frequency transistors are widely used in high-performance integrated circuits and new nanoelectronic devices. Scientists have developed a prototype graphene transistors, and optimistic to expect that soon there will be posed by the graphene carbon circuit and is widely used in people&#39;s daily lives. In addition, distinct from the two-dimensional graphene material in the electronic behavior with the three-dimensional material, can not be explained with the traditional quantum mechanics, but must use more complicated relativistic quantum mechanics to explain. Graphene for study of relativistic quantum mechanics provides a good platform for scientists Prior to this only in the high-energy cosmic rays or high-energy accelerator in the theory of verification, can now finally easily in ordinary circumstances to carry out study. <br>'
