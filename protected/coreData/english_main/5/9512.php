'cont'=>'October 5, 1998 (August 15) Tiger years, \"Galaxy III supercomputer for the first time to equip our troops. <br> \"Galaxy ¢ó\" supercomputer for the first time troops were equipped military weather support capability there to improve <br> after 3 days of rigorous testing and the smooth running of the past 10 days, \"Galaxy - ¢ó\" parallel supercomputers demonstrated superior performance in the numerical prediction of the General Staff Meteorological Center. The General Staff departments responsible comrades announced on October 5, 1998, this is \"Galaxy - III\" supercomputer first to equip our troops, it improves our military weather support capabilities and the level of modernization of extraordinary significance. <br> \"Galaxy - ¢ó\" supercomputer in September last year, the successful development of peak computing speed of up to 13 billion times per second. Preparation run-in application software development, hardware and software, the Galaxy - III \"in just more than a day to assemble first start a success, with the whole army meteorological focus on projects\" military numerical weather prediction system \"to achieve a seamless connection to the actual computing speed considerably exceeded\" Galaxy - III \"through the identification of indicators. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> \"from the &#39;birth&#39; to &#39;unmarried&#39;, &#39;Galaxy - III&#39; has completed a juicy Peugeot&#39;s big girl. \"Galaxy - III\" chief architect Yang Xuejun, expressed satisfaction with the performance of the machine. He said, \"Galaxy - III\" is the highest performance computer currently meteorological operational departments. <br> medium-and long-term numerical forecast demanding computing speed. A more complex numerical prediction model produced a 10-day forecast, million times on your computer requires 12 days of continuous operation, the operator billions of times on just two hours. (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À) <br> According to reports, numerical weather prediction system software running in a parallel computer, the development trend of the World Meteorological Applications, is a worldwide problem. Parallel the meteorological applications software, developed by the National Defense Science and Technology University and the meteorological department of the General Staff in the domestic software of its kind for the first time on a distributed memory parallel computer into practical use, the leading position in China, reached the international advanced level. Relevant persons called the military meteorological milestone events. <br> addition to the computational speed indicators can better meet the requirements of numerical prediction, \"Galaxy - III\" taken in the process of developing a new model of cooperation with the user synchronization, thereby greatly reducing the numerical prediction business application software the development cycle. <br>'
