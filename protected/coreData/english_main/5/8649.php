(L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) due Suleiman I Wenzhiwugong, in the West, he is generally hailed as Suleiman. [Today in History cn] <br> He Slam, to destroy and wipe everything out of the way things - foreign envoys reviews the Suleiman <br> occupy the continent throat of the Ottoman Turkish Empire, long jo up to 600 years. Its long years can be divided into two parts: from the founding to Suleiman era for the rising phase, and thereafter decline stage. Suleiman standing empire highest peak, \"Slam, to destroy and wipe out all the power of something\" outstanding emperors. Suleiman I <br> <br> Ottoman Empire reached the tenth generation, his nine predecessors in military forces over over a lifetime, to create a cross in a bloody The vast empire of the three continents of Asia, Africa and Europe. Inherited the the Pang Dazu industry Suleiman also a militant, and fierce king, but also with his predecessors has two significant differences: in Sudan more than before him on the throne with brothers fierce fight , and more seem domineering more than generous insufficient Suleiman as the only son, he is welcomed by the throne, his body is more filled with a serene air of an tolerant; martial arts superior to his predecessors, but sandwiches majority weak, while Suleiman has made great achievements to conquer the world, while expanding territory, also sandwiches. Sulaiman is worthy of the ideal monarch of the heyday of the great country. <br> Suleiman was the only son, but has not been pampered, but the young should be strict exercise of an heir. Xie Antrim I, his father is a genius immediately kings reigned eight years of the Ottoman Empire territory has nearly doubled. Father go out to campaign, Suleiman has presided over the affairs of state. <br> 1520, Xie of Rimsky I died, 26-year-old Suleiman inherited a large bit. As the successor of the Ottoman Empire, the first to rely on the excellent record to establish the prestige of Suleiman knows this. Throne just the more years, Suleiman will be 10 million strong north captured Belgrade. Belgrade is located in the hinterland of the Balkans, has been in Hungary under control. Captured the fortress outpost into the heart of Europe. <br> Suleiman establish the prestige of the war there to win the battle of Rhode Island. Rhode Island is a nail stuck between Asia Minor and the new empire territory of Egypt, must be pulling Knights occupy the island has a high tactical ability, Suleiman 100,000 troops laid siege to the island over 6000 Code Army, fees until nine months later won, and watched the island knights groups face withdrawal. Although the process is not smooth, but also finally reach the destination, but has since the war began, the Ottoman Empire was involved in constantly with the pirates in the Mediterranean shear and chaotic complex relationship, Pirates organization a lot of help to the Empire, but also bring a lot of trouble. (Lssjt.cn) <br> <br> Suleiman determined his sword into the heart of Christian Europe. Invaded Hungary in 1526, wiping out the main Hungarian King Louis II died in battle, \"Christian Shield\" has now entered the sphere of influence of the Ottoman Empire. This as a springboard, twice in 1529 and 1532 attack in Vienna, has not been successful in the Christian countries under the joint resistance, but the Ottoman Empire did not debilitating, occupation in most parts of Hungary. <br> Suleiman the expansion can be divided into three parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. In Asia, his opponent is Bo Sisa non the dynasty of ´ïºÕÂíË¹ÆÕ I, this public nor pushovers, the two sides conducted a protracted pull far as the war has reached a series and Yee. Suleiman, after all, has a more solid, at its best, the upper hand in this Bo Luan, accumulated southern Mesopotamia from the hands of Persia captured (including Baghdad), most of Armenia, a part of Georgia. <br> in Africa, Suleiman the use of naval forces in the Mediterranean pirate groups support, captured Tripoli and Algiers, exterminate the Spaniards support the Akkadian Wade dynasty. Suleiman continue appointing the famous the pirates \"yellow beard\" Hoey Spaulding building Navy has developed rapidly, has defeated the combined fleet of the country such as Spain and Venice in 1538 and 1541. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> is \"lightning\" kings Suleiman military achievements. Suleiman transmission to future generations \"legislators\" in the name of his sandwich and even superior. The Suleiman era promulgated <br> group River confluence, Egypt Code and Suleiman Codex Alimentarius there. Before him, Mehmed II (1451-1481 reign) era have been issued Codex, but Suleiman Codex is more complete in all respects, based on classical Islamic law, and absorption of the conquered nation&#39;s traditional method. most praiseworthy <br> Suleiman rule strategy is the development of the Miller special \". The Miller special \"meaning non-Muslim religious groups and clans and conquered so vast land, the rulers of the Ottoman Empire had confused on how to govern so many different religious and cultural customs nation, Suleiman fumble on the basis of the previous generation, and finally established the basic national policy of ethnic and religious, to allow pagan nation enjoy a certain degree of internal self-government in support of a unified empire, assume various obligations under the conditions of maintaining the national language and religious educational institutions. Suleiman era Empire \"Mile Te including Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish sects Gregory, in Western Europe, set off one after another in the persecution of pagan Hurricane, Suleiman Reich had shown a great country of tolerance, acceptance of a large number of Jews. Times <br> Suleiman the the tireless architect Sinan, under the auspices of the architectural achievements of the empire reached its peak, the classic (Lssdjt.com) which is famous Suleymaniye Mosque. Suleiman actively encourage the development of literature, art, education, and he also left the book \"War Day recorded. <br> However, despite the era of Suleiman&#39;s empire appears to be so perfect and healthy, but soon after the death of the monster began falling behind until the final reduced to the slaughter of the \"West Asia sick man. Suleiman Codex may be able to intercept certain information to explain this phenomenon. Large number of farmers has been fixed on state-owned land or feudal lords fief, without permission of movement, is also not allowed to enter the city engaged in handicraft, heavy taxes on business class, the implementation of closed line monopoly system is not conducive to commercial and industrial long-term development. Of course, the Ottoman Empire, like most Asian countries, is too powerful and too stubborn traditional binding the pace of development, it can not just blame the Suleiman or certain emperors. <br> Suleiman of the Ottoman Empire in all aspects of pique, but in terms of territorial expansion or in legal policy are just advancing along the footsteps of his predecessor&#39;s lack of originality achievements. He ranked in the middle reaches of the rankings, similar is more appropriate with Trajan, Basil II. His ranking slightly higher than that of the latter two, mainly on account of it: because the arrogant and Sulaymaniyah Manga of the Ottoman Empire to the sense of panic in the Western European Christian world, prompting Western Europe accelerated bypass exploration of new sea routes in the Middle East and Overseas adventure activities. the <br> Review: The Ottoman Empire Suleiman before the ten consecutive generations of rulers have made brilliant achievements, lasted for more than 200 years is rare in the history of the Empire rising stage. Suleiman also fruitful Ottoman exercise training mode and mechanism of competition out of a generation of male master. But from his training mechanism of the Ottoman Empire began to fall behind, this change also reflects one aspect of contemporaries in Europe is reborn. <br>'
