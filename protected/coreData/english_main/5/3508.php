The Leip have participated in the manufacture of the first atomic bomb in the United States. <br> Leip do not agree with the \"who tend to underestimate China&#39;s atomic bomb, U.S. officials. He said, these U.S. officials said China&#39;s first atomic bomb is the original, said China lacks an effective tool for carrying atomic bombs, nuclear weapons for more than a decade, does not have a true modern. <br> Lepp said, \"common sense, coupled with estimated based on the very successful reconnaissance intelligence and U.S. nuclear experience, tell us another. Lepper said that \"<br>, China\" Today is the third nuclear powers of the world, after the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain and France than China&#39;s first nuclear weapons, but they fall behind. <br> Leip said: \"sometime after 1967, Red China will be made a much more powerful than the atomic bomb, the hydrogen bomb. Now the international community do not have effective control to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. \"<br> Leip according to his knowledge, this book traces the Chinese Communists in difficult and effective way to\" perform their atomic program. Accordance Leip not go system a pregnant bombs, but engaged in the work of the much more difficult to manufacture a bomb used uranium-235. This bomb is very complex. \"<br> Leip final say in the article:\" We must not underestimate the power of nuclear energy in China. Its industry is underdeveloped in 1949 - the equivalent of the Soviet Union in the 1929 level. Now, just 15 years later, it made a staggering atomic bomb. \"<br>\" We must not because of our very successful reconnaissance told we are doing something or be complacent because of our huge nuclear arsenal many times. \"<br>'
