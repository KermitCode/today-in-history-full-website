'cont'=>'October 5, 1991 (August 28), Xinwei, Torvalds released the first Linux kernel. In In 1991, (lsjt.net) the first public version of the 0.02 version of the Linux kernel developed by Finnish computer programmer Torvalds released. <br> Linus Benner first Specter Torvalds (Linus Benedict Torvalds, 1969 December 28, 2010 -), today the world&#39;s most famous computer programmers, hackers one. The inventor of the Linux kernel and the partner in the project. Torvalds personal time and equipment to create a set today the world&#39;s most popular operating system kernel (one). <br> Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. Father, Nils Torvalds (Nils Torvalds) is an active communist and radio reporters. Torvalds family belong to the minority in Finland, accounting for 6% of the Finnish Swedes. He graduated from the University of Helsinki? Operators? C Branch? W Department, in Silicon Valley, California, from 1997 to 2003 worked at Transmeta Corporation (Transmeta Corporation)? 〣 c? Company wafer code morph technology? Research?, Now employed in the open Source Development Labs (OSDL: Open Source Development Labs, Inc), the full development of the Linux kernel. Has two children with his wife, Tove (Tove, former Finnish the woman karate champion) education. and many other hackers, <br> Torvalds acting low-key, rarely comment on the commercial competitors (such as Microsoft) product is good or bad, but adhere to the open source beliefs and rivals such as Microsoft&#39;s FUD The strategy greatly dissatisfied. <br> For example, in the e-mail a response to Craig Mundie, Microsoft&#39;s senior vice president of reviews about the open source movement (Mundie criticized the open-source movement undermined intellectual property), Torvalds wrote: \"I do not know that the Mundie you heard Sir Isaac Newton (Isaac Newton)? him not only because the creation of classical physics (as well as his and Apple&#39;s story) is famous for, is also said this word known around the world: I was able to see farther, it is because I was standing on the shoulders of giants? therefore. Torvalds said: \"I&#39;d rather listen to Newton than hear Mundie. (Lssdjt.com) he (Newton), though he were dead for nearly 300 years, but did not let the room was stinking so. October <br> in 1991, the original Internet was not as now so common, most of the Internet are part of a number of research institutes or colleges students, professors, (L $ dj而.c身m) a young Finnish university student named Linus Torvalds released comp.os.minix this newsgroup such a content less from the eyes POST: <br> Hello everybody out there a using minix - <br> the I &#39; m doing a (free) operation system (just a hobby, (l $ dj而.身r阱) <br> won&#39;t be big and professional like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones. <br> Linus interest (hobby) is the source of the 0.02 version of the Linux kernel, the original or a university student of Linus probably totally did not think he had been regarded as a personal interest in the program, in a few years there will be more than ten million users, by his own to take the lead The development of the operating system has now been generally welcomed around the world, is also seen as the biggest competitor of the software giant Microsoft&#39;s heavy promotion of the NT system. <br> Linux is a Unix-like operating system, Unix one kernel (kernel) which controls the entire system of basic services is to take the lead developed by Linus \"Linux\" name is to Linus&#39;s Minix \"named, Linus with mass public copyright\" (GPL) approach to the issue of this program, the Copyright allow anyone in any form with scattered Linux source, in other words, Linux is actually \"free the user on the network can catch the Linux source code, want to change the Linux source code, under the copyright of the growing popularity of the Internet as well as the Linux open and free to attract numerous computer expert to invest in developing improve the Linux kernel, so Linux&#39;s functionality has become increasingly powerful, so today we can on the Internet Free Linux use, or spend very little cost to the CD of Linux, because Linux GPL copyright sake . <br> <br> Reviews: open source software from the curtain <br>'
