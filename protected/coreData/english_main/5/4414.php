'cont'=>'The (Landmarks March 29), May 5, 1997, China&#39;s first medical robot surgeon operating table. the of <br> robot implementation the surgery <br> May 1997 reporters see God outside the ward at the Naval Hospital, the 9-year-old boy Li Zhipeng language fluently, walk freely, hard to believe that three days ago he had just been purposes of brain tumor surgery. This is the robot-assisted stereotactic surgery to create miracle. In the afternoon, by the Robotics Institute of the Navy General Hospital with the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, jointly developed with the success of the first medical robots, for the first time in the common instruction of two doctors and a computer expert to complete stereotactic craniopharyngioma radiation therapy, thereby opening a new chapter of the topics at the forefront of our medical surgical robot. The stereotactic surgery <br> It is understood that advanced brain surgery is currently popular in developed countries. The process is a stereotactic frame is installed in the patient&#39;s head, based on CT women described, set targets, puncture lesions, concurrent medication or destruction of lesion or damage lesions with a physical approach, without craniotomy, no anesthesia, no disease. Suitable for deep brain, smaller, such as craniopharyngioma, germ cell tumor. Gliomas, metastatic tumors and other tumors. This approach also applies to the other is not suitable for craniotomy cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral foreign body, biopsy of brain lesions, brain abscess emptying functional Neurosurgically diseases (Parkinson&#39;s disease) and other diseases, Naval General Hospital in 1987 in the country has been the first to carry out such surgery 1500 patients have been treated, the specific operation has been carried out by the doctor personally. (Lssdjt.cn) <br> As for the reasons to enable the robot to alternative doctors manually, the hospital Neurosurgically Center doctors is based on four considerations: First, the robot positioning is more accurate, reduce human error; Second, it could replace the medical personnel damage the operation, such as the injection of radioisotope; robot positioning time, positioning accuracy, less invasive; robot can pre-simulated surgical operation, choose the best approach for surgical program. He said that the few developed countries in the international community from the 1990s, working on a medical surgical robot Currently, only the United States, Japan, France and other countries used in clinical surgery. <br> robot-assisted surgery process scenarios can be described as breathtaking. Li Zhipeng example, he is suffering from craniopharyngioma anesthesia craniotomy relapse after three years of 3x3x2.5 cm tumor. Step is a visit to Beijing for surgery after the first CT scan positioning the film into the scanner input into the computer, determine the target for the three-dimensional coordinates, doctors drill the skull with a diameter of 2.5 mm bone mouth, the robot program control , the robot will puncture needle into the target tumor fluid outflow, a doctor with a syringe through the needle out of 21 milliliters tumor fluid, and then the robot will radioisotope phosphorus - 32 (to completely cure the disease slowly kill tumor parietal cells) 1.2 mCi injected into the tumor cavity, and then the robot to pull out the needle, the doctor bandaged the wound. The surgical procedure is only 45 minutes. Patient Li Zhipeng out of the operating room, headache, high intracranial pressure namely mitigation, vision returned to normal. Two hours later, Li Zhipeng that eating milk, no complications. <br> experts predict, the study and use of medical surgical robots will not only precise positioning of the surgical site, the surgery reduce injury to bring a series of technological change, and will change the concept of conventional medical surgery. <br> According to reports, China&#39;s first medical robot still further improved, the appropriate time will promote the use in clinical. the <br> third postoperative day, Li Zhipeng language fluently <br>'
