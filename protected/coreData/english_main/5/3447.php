'class'=>4,
'cont'=>'April 5, 1707 (on March 3rd Chinese New Year), the famous Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler was born. ¡¤ <br> Leonhard Euler, Swiss mathematician and physicist. He was known as one of the two greatest mathematicians in history (the other was Carl Friedrich Gauss). Euler was the first to use the word \"function\" to describe expression that contains a variety of parameters, such as: Y = F (x) (a function is defined by Leibniz given in 1694). He is one of the pioneers of the calculus used in physics. <br> Euler was born in Switzerland, and in education. Euler is a math whiz. Him as a professor of mathematics, has taught at St. Petersburg and Berlin (the L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) Seoul and then returned to St. Petersburg. Euler was the most prolific mathematicians in history, a total of 75 volumes of his complete works. Euler actually dominated the 18th-century mathematics, then newly invented calculus, he derived a lot of results. In the last seven years of his life, Euler&#39;s total loss of sight, he nevertheless produced at an alarming rate life of half of the book. <br> Euler&#39;s life is very devout. However, that widespread legend is not true. Legend comes to the court of Catherine II, Euler, challenges Denis Diderot: \"Sir, (a + b) n / n = x; Therefore, the existence of God, this is the answer ! \"<br> Euler&#39;s death is very special: It was reported that it is tea time being funny grandchildren play a piece of cake stuck in the throat suffocated. <br> asteroid Euler 2002 is named to commemorate the Euler. <br>'
