'cont'=>'In June (Ding eighth day), July 5, 1957, the Ma Yinchu published \"New Population Theory\" was doom. <br> <br> in 1957, \"People&#39;s Daily\" published the Ma Yinchu in June 1957 in a written statement on the fourth meeting of the first session of the National People&#39;s Congress. He that China&#39;s population according to the census for the first time in the history of our country in 1953 and the population growth in the next few years, the proliferation of too fast. June 30, 1953, the population of China a total of 601,938,035 people, this is a static record. Same year, selected 10 counties in 29 large and medium-sized cities, the province of Ningxia, the rest of the provinces, each province to conduct a census, and another 35 counties only check one district, the two towns, 58 townships, nine villages, a total of 3018 people, birth rate thirty-seven thousandths mortality seventeen thousandths population proliferation rate of twenty thousandths. But considered from the social situation in 1953, people&#39;s living standards improve, the number of marriages increased welfare and care, pregnant women, maternal and infant mortality in the elderly reduce domestic order and stability, as well as the people ideologically hope many fortunes, what V Qichang, children and grandchildren, the unfilial three big old residual effects after no the Mr. Ma Yinchu estimate the proliferation rate of the population in the past four years is likely in the more than twenty thousandths. Base of 600 million, annually to twenty thousandths speed growth, all people of insight, can not help but think that such growth go too impressive, too fast. Thus, the (history TodayOnHistory.com) Mr. Ma Yinchu that, in order to expand the production and reproduction of accelerated capital accumulation. Accelerate the process of industrialization, should reduce the proportion of consumption, which must be population control. At the same time, in order to further improve the people&#39;s living standards, expand the source of the light industry raw materials, to improve the level of food consumption, as well as for the promotion of scientific research career, he thinks \"nor control the population not,\" the proliferation of the population, is the accumulation of reducing industrialization postponed \",\" So unless the population problem as early as whom Figure inevitably farmers Qieen De becomes disappointment and discontent, ...... can not help but bring a lot of difficulties to the government \". In order to improve the labor productivity of farmers, in order to improve their material and cultural living standards, side to accumulate funds side should control the population. the points analysis shows the <br> Mr. Ma Yinchu doing, put forward three proposals: (a) proposed to conduct a census in 1958 and later in 1963 for universal suffrage, so that we can know this the actual situation of China&#39;s population growth in 5 years or 10 years, followed by seriously hold vital statistics, population policy determined on this basis, population growth in the digital side of the set into the second or third five-year plan so the accuracy of the scheme can be gradually improved; (b) to birth control, to control population, the first step is to rely on widespread publicity so that the people are aware of the importance of birth control, and can be a practical application of birth control, side vigorously publicize the harmful effects of early marriage, late marriage benefits. If you control the power of the population is not big enough, since the executive power should be complemented by a tougher, more effective. Countries should interfere in fertility, the right to control the population; (c) implementation of family planning to control population is the best and most effective way, the most important is the widespread promotion of contraceptive ...... Mr. Ma Yinchu New Population Theory \" main content. <br> now \"New Population Theory\" in the thoroughness and depth of the theory and the elaboration of the problem, and there are some deficiencies, imperfect, and even some inaccurate, but it does a very important issue. Rereading \"New Population Theory\" today, still feel feel even more direct practical significance. If since then, as it is today, so really pay attention to this problem, correctly treat the views of others, the spirit of searching for truth, the spirit of the pursuit of truth, to examine this issue, the spirit of the struggle for truth and to publicize it. I am afraid that not more than 20 years of population growth so fast, difficult not to reach such an extent that today. Unfortunately, that did not do so in time. Conversely, on the Mr. Ma Yinchu its New Population Theory \"was massive criticism, big uncritical, plus a many untruths slander. <br> gave the \"New Population Theory\" wearing hat: Malthusianism. Based: \"New Population Theory\" with Malthus identical starting from the socio-economic system to analyze population issues to talk about human sexuality, quantity, quality, reproductive rate, and their impact on economic development, but the abstract; denied \"is a good thing,\" the important principle of such a so-called historical materialism; talking about the quality of the population; talk about the problem of the relationship between population and food;, etc. Wearing hat to the \"New Population Theory: deny the superiority of the socialist system. \"New Population Theory\", said: \"I am convinced that the more developed of the cause of socialism, the mechanization and automation will inevitably ensues, front a thousand people to do things, mechanization, automation later, 50 people can do (assuming everywhere are twentieth), will the remaining 950 people how to do? Therefore, I will take into account the many people, you can not quickly mechanization and automation. Added: \"China to build socialism, should engage in large-scale industrial, Lenin also said there are no major industrial, no socialism (Lenin Collected Works 7, 151). However, too much of the population, it is holding the hind legs of our high-speed industrialization, we can not march forward. \"The increase in this year, 1300 people, placement industry, but 100 million people (according to Li Fuchun, Vice Prime Minister of the second five-year plan description), the remaining 12 million people want to work in rural. Mr. Ma Yinchu that the side effects of which will inevitably occur. \"Today&#39;s farmers for their own food production, total want to leave some for the daily needs of residents to the city gradually in line. They eat the oil, the oil today tense more than food, they wear new clothes, so the cloth is not enough ... so a year out of a population of 12 million proliferation placement in rural, can neither increase their labor productivity in the short term, living needs, but also to the city on par, over time, how had. \"\" New Population Theory \"wearing hat: the lack of affection of a population of 600 million. Due to the one-sided propaganda of theory, practical measures are ineffective, resulting in the rapid growth of China&#39;s population. <br> the Ma Yinchu Zhejiang Shengzhou County, born in 1882.
