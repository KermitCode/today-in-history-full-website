'cont'=>'August 5, 1998 (June 14) Tiger years, the financial the large jaw Soros attack the Hong Kong dollar. George Soros <br> 1997 <br> Soros in Thailand sold a lot of Baht This is considered to be the fuse of the Southeast Asian financial crisis of world attention. <br> 1998 August 5 to 28, the Soros-led a number of giant international financial institutions (investment funds and investment banks to the United States as the main force) teamed up with China and Hong Kong SAR Government in the foreign exchange market, stock market, futures market, a battle of wits temporarily come to an end, both parties invested heavily in the \"battle\" of about two weeks, the Government victory. Reports on the causes of the Asian financial crisis, as well as the Hong Kong Government and the international speculators in the financial markets \"battle\", more and more attention of people gathered to fame became louder and louder George - George Soros body. (History com) 1930 <br> George - George Soros was born in Budapest, Hungary, to a Jewish family lawyer. 1943-1944 Soros a pseudonym to escape Nazi hunt using forged documents. In 1947 he moved to England. A 1954-1979 in obscurity in London and New York engaged in securities trading and financial analysis, emigrated to the United States in 1956, married and became a U.S. citizen in 1961. <br> 1979, Soros Soros Fund co-founded in 1973 was renamed the Quantum Fund. To 199o, \"Soros Fund (IMF) has established 89 institutions in 26 countries. the <br> 1992, Soros to take advantage of the sterling crisis, earned a record $ 1.5 billion in just one month, and school board members as a major funding to the University of Oxford. <br> 1993 annual revenue of $ 1.1 billion, Soros has become an annual income of over $ 1 billion in U.S. history. When the U.S. personal income top the 1OO name 9 artificially Soros Foundation. Subsequent Soros fame, the cover of the U.S. \"Business Week\" to become \"one can change the character of the market in 1993. In June 1994, the Wall Street Journal called \"the bad boy of the global financial community. The \"<br> existing material reveals, Soros may be a gambler, but he definitely had the courage to Super gamblers. Like all gamblers, Soros has extraordinary self-confidence. Believe in yourself to determine the correct investment position is never too big. General gamblers, Soros also has the ability to survive in the dead. He likes to say: \"If you did not do a good job, the first action is to close hand, do not want to win back their money. Start again, start small. \"Soros intuition and flexibility are often the people around him praiseworthy. <br> Soros does not spend a lot of time reading research stock analysis report, mainly through reading is not necessarily related to the financial newspaper, and maintain contact with the world&#39;s authoritative source, to form their own opinions and judgments. And Wall Street investment magnate Warren - Warren Buffett, he thinks there is no theoretical basis for the technical analysis of securities, real useful basic analysis. Soros most distinctive personal traits, perhaps he was able to contact the world leaders and authority figures. This no need to apply, however, extremely difficult to enter the \"club\" by the outstanding figures of the national political and economic circles: heads of state, finance ministers, central bank president ... status with them a far cry from the Soros, however, was to play into this extreme xenophobic circles. Soros captured the market growing influence, the other members of the \"club\" had to pay attention to his views, to understand the decision he might make, of course, this interest is mutual. With this convenient, Soros was able to understand global events and global operational procedures. Remove the personal qualities, Soros is also extremely good at clever use of market force. In the in every decisive \"battle\", Soros not only guts devoted his entire force, but also to capitalize on the trend mustered a large number of followers, a horrifying scale power blocs. It is hard to believe that, like Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan - Stanley financial \"Big Mac\" in conjunction with the Soros teamed up with the Hong Kong government to act against! On August 2, the port city throughout the day turnover reached not only unprecedented and probably unrepeatable of HK $ 79 billion this height alone Soros a person is unable to match. Use an analogy, Soros is like a school of sharks in the first of prey to attack the other end of the giant shark, once succeeded, smell bloody size sharks will swarm the prey bite the empty one. <br> front row, third from right is a battle of wits with the Soros Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang <br>'
