'cont'=>'The (Baba twelfth lunar month sixth days), January 5, 1930, Mao Zedong writing \"A single spark can start a prairie fire. <br> Mao Zedong to Lin Biao&#39;s letter (\"A single spark can start a prairie fire.\") <br> 1927, after the failure of the Revolution, the Party&#39;s work focus from cities into rural areas, the National Revolution temporarily into the doldrums, the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong establish The first rural revolutionary base - Jinggangshan base. However, when the party \"Left\" thinking people, still fantasy held in the city as the center of the armed uprising; Lin Biao as pessimistic thinking \"right opportunist by in a powerful enemy offensive front, doubt the future development of the revolutionary base areas, the \"red flag in the end play how long\" questions. They do not believe in the revolutionary upsurge is fast approaching, do not want to go through hard work to create rural revolutionary base, advocate the use of roving guerrilla to extend political influence, to wait until all parts of the country to fight for the masses do a good job, come back a nationwide armed uprising. <br> 1930, Mao Zedong, in order to criticize the party&#39;s pessimistic thinking to Lin Biao, wrote a letter, this letter is later income \"Selected Works of Mao Zedong,\" the first volume of \"A single spark can start a prairie fire. . \" <br> Mao Zedong in the letter criticized the erroneous ideas of Lin Biao, pointed out: one subjective forces of the revolution in China is weak, but based on the above behind China&#39;s fragile social and economic organization of the reactionary ruling class Organization (regime , armed, political parties, etc.) is also weak. Second, after the failure of the 1927 revolution, the subjective forces of the revolution is indeed greatly weakened, but \"A single spark can start a prairie fire\" is only a little bit of strength, its development is very fast. Measure of counter-revolutionary forces must not look at the phenomenon, going to see it in real terms. The end of 1928 to early 1929, the enemy of the Jinggangshan base three times \"will destroy\", as if the very powerful, in fact, the struggle of Britain, the U.S., Japan, China has been very explicit warlord has been formed, in essence, this is a counter-revolutionary trend began to decline, the tide of the revolution began to revive. Fourth, the objective reality, the various contradictions forward, the country full of dry wood fuel into the fire soon. Dialectical <br> Mao Zedong in his letter, the scientific analysis of the domestic political situation and the enemy forces contrast, critical exaggerated putschism the subjective forces of the revolution and do not see the development of the revolutionary forces of pessimistic thinking, \"in the Chinese revolution, the facts do not fit. \" Letter full estimate of the significance and role of the red regime in the establishment and development of the Chinese revolution, encircling the city, armed seizure of power thinking. Clearly pointed out: \"the Red Army, the establishment and development of the guerrillas and the red area is the highest form of semi-colonial and Chinese farmers struggle under the leadership of the proletariat,\" the most important factors to promote the national revolutionary upsurge \". Mao Zedong in a letter to Lin Biao, has actually started to form encircling the cities from the rural areas, and then capture the idea of &#8203;&#8203;the city, which is made in a semi-colonial, revolutionary struggle in the feudal powers of the East The new conclusion, a significant development on the armed seizure of power theory of Marxism. <br>'
