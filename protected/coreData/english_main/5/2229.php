'cont'=>'March 5, 1989 (, Baba first month 28), Save the Ozone Layer, the World Conference. <br> ozone is concentrated levels of ozone in the stratosphere, about 20-25 km from the ground. The ozone layer can solar radiation to the the ultraviolet absorb 99% of the Earth&#39;s surface, thereby protecting life on Earth from UV damage. If the destruction of the ozone layer, the ultraviolet radiation of the Earth&#39;s surface will be enhanced, also increases the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts, will break the balance of the marine ecosystem, the crop will be a large number of cuts ... the <br> 1985 years, scientists have discovered over the Antarctic ozone hole of a size such as the area of &#8203;&#8203;the continental United States, the second year of the ozone hole over the Arctic, an area as large as Greenland. After an investigation, the various parts of the Earth has a different degree of ozone depletion. If this trend continues, the fate of mankind will be threatened. The culprit causing ozone depletion <br> on HCFCs. This compound is very stable, into the atmosphere has been rising to the stratosphere, it will break down and release chlorine atoms in the stratosphere by solar UV irradiation. Chlorine atoms of ozone has a strong affinity, a chlorine atom can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. Now, the chlorine concentration in the atmosphere by 0.035%, and every 10 years millionth of the rate of increase. The chlorine concentration in the atmosphere is only 1900 ppm 0.6. <br> chlorofluorocarbons can not only damage the ozone layer, but also intensify the greenhouse effect, the global temperature increases, climate change, so covered with Greenland and southern Arctic ice melt, sea levels to rise, flooding coastal cities even engulf a number of countries. <br> in order to protect all living things on earth, save the ozone layer, it is necessary to prohibit the use of chlorofluorocarbons. <br> chlorofluorocarbons, also known as Freon, invented in 1930, is used in refrigerators, air conditioners, foam, solvent, aerosol sprays, and the electronics industry. Half a century later, scientists found it for the benefit of mankind, while to the human hazards. Many countries have begun to take measures to reduce or stop using chlorofluorocarbons. <br> under the initiative of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on March 5, 1989, to save the ozone layer World Congress held in London. Representatives of 123 countries attended the meeting, including 80 ministerial-level representatives, in addition to representatives of international organizations, renowned scientists and entrepreneurs. The main purpose of this conference is to mobilize the participation of developing countries in the Montreal Protocol. The Montreal Protocol, a treaty to protect the ozone layer International Congress in Montreal in 1987, which provides that \"at the end of the century, the industrialized countries chlorofluorocarbons 50% reduction in the use. 20 countries hope to sign the Protocol on the London Assembly, another 12 countries, said it would seriously consider. <br> the London Assembly to promote awareness of the dangers of the ozone layer destruction. But scientists say ozone Even now, immediately disable chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone layer will continue to reduce in the next 10 years, has been reduced to 100 years in order to make up for it, so do not be taken lightly. <br>'
