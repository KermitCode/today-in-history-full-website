October 8, the Senate was originally scheduled to vote on the appointment of Thomas, if passed, Thomas can take office. But at this critical juncture, Thomas former female aide accused him 10 years ago, \"sexual harassment\" of her things suddenly leaked, forcing the Senate postponed a vote to find out the whole story. <br> originally held the Thomas confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee during former female assistant, the current Oklahoma State University law professor Anita - Hill raised the allegations, the FBI also for investigation, but Hill and Thomas uncompromising, things can not make a conclusion.

Thomas testified that certain people and certain interest groups to unite him \"personality damage. Not only that, a Yale University law professor witnessed the drawbacks of the hearing process, the article pointed out, the problem now is that this hearing process \"has become absurd\", has reached such a point, that any nominee shall be guilty of any wrongdoing, or are likely to become a political \"victim\". <br>'
