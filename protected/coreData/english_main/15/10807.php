'cont'=>'(, Boshin October seventh day), November 15, 1988, the Soviet Union, the first launch of the space shuttle. <br> 1988 11 15, the Soviet Union at the Baikonur launch site at 6:00 Moscow time using the \"energy\" large generic launch vehicle into space, the space shuttle \"blizzard\". This is the Soviet Union after years of research and development, large-scale practical test after the first launch of the space shuttle. <br> Soviet Union developed the space shuttle program began in the 1970s. According to reports, the way of the Soviet Union developed the space shuttle and the United States. Soviet Union to start the development of reduced scale small space shuttle to start, validate the aerodynamic performance of the flight, the flight characteristics of the horizontal landing, and thermal protection ablation, and conducted several test flights. In recent years, the Western newspapers published a picture of the shooting from the satellite to the Soviet space shuttle. , <br> 1987, the Soviet Union held in Moscow international seminar on \"Aerospace Forum for the Future\", to invite the participation of the United States and other countries hundreds of aerospace engineers, scientists, astronauts. At this meeting, the Soviet Union, told the foreign representatives to disclose its space shuttle program. Earlier this year, the Soviet Union developed and Space Administration is responsible for Borg Diya Ze announced that the the Soviet large practical space shuttle is in the final stage of the trial. \"blizzard\" space shuttle <br> the Soviet Union launched an unmanned, thanks to the automatic control system flight and return to the ground. Soviet \"Pravda\" the story said, fully automatic landing is a very difficult task. Subject to greater restrictions than ordinary aircraft due to the space shuttle landing. It has no engine traction, but the use of aerodynamic principle that high-speed, the highly deviated gliding, rushed to the landing site only consumed a lot of acceleration energy. Even thousands of miles away, can not change the landing site. If the landing is not accurate, nor circling then fly around and to conduct the second landing. The U.S. space shuttle landing by astronauts driving. <br> \"energy\" carrier rocket is the latest high-power booster rocket in the Soviet Union, the first test-launch in May last year. According to reports, this rocket can be reused, can the heavy scientific instruments into space. Baikonur Space Center in Soviet Central Asia Syr Darya north shore, is the largest Soviet launch site, the venue has a long runway for space shuttle landings. Sputnik is launched into space from here. purpose <br> Soviet Union&#39;s space shuttle launch unmanned space shuttle into orbit, the flight and automatically return to the ground structure of the system as well as the space shuttle comprehensive test and further drill carrier rocket and ground control flight facilities. Soviet parties concerned believe that the use of the space shuttle will allow the Soviet Union to expand with foreign countries in the peaceful exploration and use of space commercial cooperation.
