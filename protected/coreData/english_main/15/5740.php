The Chinese have a saying called the final nail, although not draw a fast, can always conclusive! My life did two things, one bucket with Chiang Kai-shek for decades, he rushed to several islands up to the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, the Japanese invited back to his home in the. The few dissenting these things, only a few people chattering in my ear, is nothing more than let me as soon as possible to recover several islands Bale.
