'cont'=>'December 15, 1998 (October 27), Tiger years, \"Chronology Project\" special report will be held. , <br> 1998 12 15 (Lssdjt.com) national research programs in the Ninth Five-Year Plan \"top priority\" project \"Chronology Project\" research has made important progress in the country CPPCC Cultural and Historical Data Committee and the science, education Committee held a special report. Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. <br> Li said, Shang and Zhou formation period of our civilization, our culture has laid period, during this period the achievements of civilization influence in China for thousands of years. However, it is very regrettable that, during this period we do not have the exact chronology. The chronology established three generations, for scientific research of the history of five thousand years of civilization created favorable conditions for an outstanding contribution to the research on the history of the world. <br> Li said, in accordance with the Marxist point of view, the human understanding of the world is mainly dependent on the material and production activities, material production activities gradually understanding the law of nature, the relationship between man and nature, as well as the interpersonal relationship. Science and technology as a powerful driving force to promote the progress of human civilization, not only profoundly changed the face of the material world and profoundly change the ability of people to understand the world and the way to change people&#39;s perception of the world. People one-sided understanding of the history of social, error, some social science to their own problems, while others are limited by the level of natural science, that the limitations of the so-called social and historical conditions, the level of development of science and technology limitations. Recalling the history of the development of human knowledge, every time a major breakthrough in the natural sciences are to make people leap in understanding many of the problems occurred on the field of the humanities, and even lead to a new understanding of some existing conclusions. The humanities must pay attention and catch up with the development of science and technology, good absorb nutrients from the latest achievements of science and technology to find the means to raise their level of awareness. \"Chronology Project\" achieved results is that the humanities and modern technology combined with the results. We celebrate this major achievement, but also celebrate the way to achieve results, and hope to have more issues in this way. In September, <br> 2000 various topics through acceptance on the basis of the \"Chronology Project\" how disciplinary research support to meet as many conditions as much as possible with the relevant data agreement, each historical stage era of mutual contact of the Xia, Shang and Zhou Chronology \"and\" Chronology Project phased 1996-2000 achievements Report and passed the national acceptance. Engineering expert and engineering inspection group that [the L $ dj而.妨壯T] This is by far the most scientific basis for the Shang and Zhou Chronology, under the existing conditions can obtain the best results, represents The chronology of the highest level. (L $ j而.c里) In September 15, the Chronology Project overall project, by the acceptance of the inspection group headed by the director of the National Natural Science Fund Committee, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Chen Jiaer 15. <br> acceptance of the Expert Group in the final review comments: Chronology Project in the implementation of the historical documents and Oracle, Jin and other ancient writing material collecting, sorting, identification, analysis of the relevant astronomical calendar records by The modern astronomy presumed the years, The typical formulation chronology ruins and tombs finishing series of samples to improve the carbon-14 dating method. On this basis, a comprehensive analysis of the conclusions drawn, the Xia and Shang Dynasties scientific basis geochronology significant initial results. Which the late Shang Dynasty Pangeng the following king and the Western Zhou republican first year of the previous king proposed a more accurate age of the early Shang Dynasty Xia Dynasty basic chronological framework. In particular, the Zhou era of King Wu grams, Wu Ding reign years, the Xia and Shang boundaries of age and the Xia Dynasty began years assessed, an important innovation significance. Xia Shang Zhou Chronology derived above, the historical chronology of ancient China by far the most science-based BC 841 years before. <br> 2000, through the efforts of the 200 more than we bring together experts and scholars, traced the origin of Chinese civilization, the Shang and Zhou Kai Chinese civilization to finally clear geochronology ruler. This day, \"Chronology Project\" officially announced \"Xia Shang Zhou Chronology\", the a Republican first year of our country&#39;s historical chronology from the late Western Zhou Dynasty, that is 841 years BC extended forward 1,200 years to make up for the Chinese a major shortcoming of the study of ancient civilizations. <br> Chinese civilization is widely recognized as one of civilization, and the world without interruption, has been stretching and preach the flow of civilization, but rise to a thriving Shang and Zhou marks the Chinese civilization has been World No Annual become a major shortcoming in the Chinese history, and the history of the world. The turn of the century to complete this Xia Shang Zhou Chronology \", has made a solid effort to fill the blank in ancient China Annals. According to this chronology, summer on behalf of the beginning of the year about 2070 BC; Xia and Shang boundaries around 1600 BC; Pan Geng moved to Yin approximately 1300 BC; Shang and Zhou boundaries in 1046 BC. The chronology discharge specific reign of the king of the Western Zhou Dynasty 10, and discharged the late Shang Dynasty from Pangeng to Di Xin (Zhou) 12 Wang roughly reign. (L $ dj而.c身m) <br> data Chronology Project chief scientist Li Xueqin, started in May 1996 national key scientific and technological project of the Ninth Five-Year Plan \"Chronology Project\" launched a shock to the scholars will be up and down from the Western Han Dynasty began ancient historical problems of poor cable. The past five years, this project concentrated 200 more than we bring together experts and scholars in the disciplines of history, archeology, astronomy, science and technology dating science were established, in accordance with the requirements of the system engineering, the 44 topics of the nine subjects, from different angles, different sides, different approaches, different ways of Shang and Zhou geochronology comprehensive new research, research. Different the traditional chronology Institute with the past, more than a thousand years, this project has taken a multidisciplinary joint research, the method of cross-over study, especially for those who are more controversial, and the entire framework is crucial in the era of the dating taken a very cautious approach, and strive to make the conclusion that to get more clues, multi-angle support.
