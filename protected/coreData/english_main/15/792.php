'cont'=>'January 15, 1850 (Jiyou the twelfth lunar month, third), the first female Academy of Sciences of Sofia Kewaliefu Kaya&#39;s birthday. <br> of Sofia Kewaliefu Kaya or Sufi Kewaliefu Kaya (Софья Васильевна Ковалевская, 1850 January 15, 2011 -1891 years, 10 days), Russian female mathematician. Ph.D., University of G&#246;ttingen, Germany. He was a professor at the University of Stockholm. Important contribution in terms of partial differential equations and the theory of rigid body rotation. Pinwheel problem solve rigid body around 1888 France Academy of Baoting Award, and became the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, is the first female Russian history to receive this title, but also the history of the world&#39;s first female scientists of the Academy of Sciences. <br> Kewaliefu Kaya was born in Moscow on January 15, 1850. Her father Crewe Khodorkovsky, a Russian lieutenant general, the grandfather is the descendants of the king of Hungary, an astronomer and mathematician, in order to marry a beautiful wandering around Bohemia woman lost the status of Prince . The Sophia&#39;s childhood and girlhood spent in Barry Po near the Lithuanian border promise Grange. <br> 8 years old, Sophia tutor her math, but good at creating their own unique way. Juvenile, Sophia often self-a higher deep mathematical knowledge. In the fall of 1866 with his parents, 16-year-old Sophia came to St. Petersburg. Here, she was under the guidance of the famous educator Strano Liu Bo Siji, after reading higher mathematics, but she can not enter the university, because the Russian was not allowed women access to higher education. <br> family in order to be able to leave the autocratic, Kewaliefu Kaya in 1868 and paleontologists, geologists 柯瓦列夫斯基 fake marriage. Moved to Germany in 1869, along with \"husband\" (later a long time to spend with each other to enhance understanding, they really married). Overcome difficulties, Sophia finally entered the University of Heidelberg, learning math mathematician Cornelius Pressburger professor, (lssdjt.cn) and to listen to the great physicist Helmholtz physics class. Gurney Pressburger class often glorify his teacher, Weierstrass known as \"the father of mathematical analysis, it has provoked Sophia reverence his mathematics master, she was determined to go to Berlin. In 1870, the 20-year-old Sophia after efforts to Berlin and personally visit the world-famous mathematician - Weierstrass. Sophia&#39;s adamant, and quite a thoughtful answer Weierstrass problems do the top students in the past, was originally not in favor of women engaged in scientific research work Weierstrass exceptional extrusion from the busy schedule every Sunday afternoon lectures to give the girl alone in their own homes. Weierstrass&#39;s carefully cultivated, and Sophie felt the style of The Masters of Science, studying hard and give full play to her aptitude for mathematics. Four years of study in Berlin, she not only completed all college courses, and the completion of the three important papers. The three papers in the theory of partial differential equations, Abel&#39;s integral and has an important contribution to the shape of Saturn&#39;s rings. 1874, granted her the highest honor of the Ph.D. degree, University of Goettingen, Germany, Sophia became a mathematics doctoral students in history. Sophia then 24-year-old. <br> 1874, Sophia returned to Russia, but Russian women go to science and the road is still not open, Sofia unable to find a job in any one colleges and universities. She could only give up the mathematical expertise, engaged in literary and journalistic work. Sophia can seriously treat each job in a literary achievements, published the novel \"female nihilist, screenplay\" struggle \"happiness and other good works. The end of 1879, at the suggestion of the famous Russian mathematician Chebyshev, Sophia Russian the sixth natural scientists and doctors Congress made a special report on Abel&#39;s integral, mathematicians have been present at the meeting praised. <br> 1880 year-end, Sophia came to Berlin in mathematical research under the guidance of the Weierstrass completed several articles about light refraction research papers. Unfortunately, the spring of 1883, her husband committed suicide because of bankruptcy, she was brave enough to stir up the burden of life. Candidates in 1883 to the help of friends, a lecturer of the University of Stockholm. Local Democratic newspaper with the following few words reported her arrival: \"Today we are not reported in a vulgar prince arrived ... the scientific Princess 柯瓦列夫斯基 Lady visit to our city, she will Sweden first female lecturer. \"The first year, she was still in German taught the theory of partial differential equations, the second year, she will be able to lectures in Swedish. Here, she has served a 12-course teaching of mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and other disciplines. In 1889, he was appointed as a tenured professor at the University of Stockholm, to become the world&#39;s first female Professor. <br> at Stockholm University during his tenure, Sofia rigid body around a fixed point rotation. Was \"Baoting Award\" the results achieved in the essay of the Paris Academy of Sciences Award 1888 assessment, the judges, this paper gives a comprehensive solution of the subject in each case, a higher scientific value, agreed to the original prize money of three thousand francs to 5000 francs. Later, because the result has been improved, the work in 1889, the Swedish Academy of Sciences awards. <br> Sophia in exotic high status and honor, but the tsarist government did not agree to return to work. Chebyshev led by the efforts of a group of scholars, the Department of Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in November 1889 formally adopted the of Sofia ・ Kewaliefu Kaya is Corresponding Member, this is the first title of the Academy of Sciences women scientists. (Lssdjt.com) In 1890 winter, Sophia had returned to Russia, hoping to find a job in the country, but have not yet successfully. On his way back to Sweden, due to cold-induced pneumonia, never YiBingBuQi. February 10, 1891, the great female mathematician Sofia Kewaliefu, Kaya died in Stockholm, when he was only 41 years old. <br>'
