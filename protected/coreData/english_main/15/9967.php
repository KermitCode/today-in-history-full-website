'cont'=>'October 15, 1986 (September 12) Bingyin, American Chinese Yuan T. Lee won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. <br> Yuan T. Lee won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"target =\" _blank \"> Lee Yuan-tse <br> Chinese-American Dr. Li Yuanzhe won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the 15th, adding luster and honor for the Chinese people, (L $ dj而 . c身m) Chinese American lead to the proud. <br> Yuan T. Lee after the American physicist Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang and Samuel Ting, the fourth Chinese Americans get the Nobel Prize, he is also the first woman to win the prize origin Taiwan Province of scientists. (Lssdjt.com) <br> 1936 Nian, [1 $ dj而.c身m] Yuan T. Lee was born in Taiwan, Hsinchu County, father, elder Lee is an eighty-old Taiwanese painter. (1 $ dj而 . c身m) Yuan T. Lee obtained a master&#39;s degree in Taiwan in 1962, the U.S. postgraduate student at Berkeley, California State University, 1965 PhD in chemistry from any professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago from 1968 to 1974. since 1974, he served as Professor of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, (L $ dj而.妨壯T) and served as the principal investigator of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. become an American citizen in 1974. Academy of Sciences of the United States. <br> The Yuan T. Lee winning He crossed molecular beam studies, an understanding of the basic principles of the chemicals react with each other, to make an important breakthrough, has opened a new field of chemical kinetics. Molecular Beam is a new knowledge, the past two decades was successfully tested. crossover molecular beam methods Yuan T. Lee PhD, and this was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry Advisor Hirsch Bach joint research created over the past ten years, Lee Yuan-tse and the continuous improvement of this innovative technology, the use of this method larger molecules important reaction in research he designed a \"molecular beam impinges, and the ion beam cross-instrument can analyze each stage of the process of the various chemical reactions. Currently, molecular beam in the industrial play a significant role. example, the development of VLSI, to borrow a molecular beam technology, high purity semiconductor atoms accumulate on the computer board. <br> Yuan T. Lee won the Nobel Prize news, his and Chinese academia, as well as teachers and students of the University of California, Berkeley, where he teaches are very excited to have congratulated him, praised his diligence study spirit Yuan T.

Lee made a great contribution to research work on the promotion of cross-strait addition to serving as Academia Sinica, Taiwan the academicians outside, also to assist the Academia Sinica, Taiwan Institute of Atomic and Molecular Design, installation part of the sub-beam collision instrument scheduled to be completed by the end of ten years, he has been to carry out academic exchanges with the University of Science and Technology of China, and help the Department of Chemistry, HKUST to carry out chemical dynamics research. (lsjt.net) University of Science and Technology of China and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Shanghai Fudan University awarded him an honorary title of professor He also directs the Dalian Institute of Biology and the Beijing Institute of Chemistry, the establishment of the three sets of molecular beam apparatus. <br>'
