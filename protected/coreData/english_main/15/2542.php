'cont'=>'March 15, 2005 (, Yiyou February sixth days), KFC Sudan incident. <br> 2005 3 15, the relevant departments in Shanghai KFC several restaurants sampling, found in the wings of New Orleans and New Orleans chicken burger seasoning contains \"Sudan\" ingredients. On the morning of the 16th, the inform national KFC Yum headquarters segment, \"from the 16th, immediately in all KFC restaurants to stop selling New Orleans chicken wings and the New Orleans chicken burger products, destroy all remaining spices. The afternoon of March 16, Yum statement announced Orleans roast wings and the New Orleans roast chicken burger sauce were found to contain Sudan I apologize to the public. Yum, the (history today www.lssdjt.com) strict tracing suppliers spices in the illegal use of \"Sudan\" responsibility. March 17, the Beijing Municipal Food Safety Office Emergency announced, the city authorities detection KFC raw spicy marinade powder the Sudan incident \"possibly carcinogenic\" target = \"_blank\"> Sudan I \" , this raw material is mainly used in the three products \"Spicy chicken burger, spicy chicken wings\" and \"the world&#39;s best chicken rice flower\" also occurred during the encounter things difficult for consumers the invoice to the KFC claims In this regard, the KFC explanation, which is that they self-examination of the results: March 17 KFC macro aromatic material (Kunshan) Co., Ltd. with Sudan red chili powder found in the records used in the three spices. Subsequently, they take emergency measures, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) existing after verify that the sauce does not contain Sudan Red instead of spices. precisely at this time, March 18, Beijing authorities spot checks to a group spices on the 19th released to the media, ordered to stop selling this incident has greatly improved people&#39;s Consumer Protection awareness Sudan incident became the talk of people gossip <br> the past two months, since, in particular the World well-known fast-food magnate the KFC was traced to several products containing sudan, sudan event Gengshi boiling to the extreme. despite the March 23, KFC involving red product sales has been fully restored, but the the Sudan incident has not corpuscles meaning. In fact, in the Kentucky sudan event reached its climax under cabinet sale time, a lot of insight on the proposed reflect one that I also think, is the time, do not miss this warming Jin < br> sudan Should red? <br> Currently, sudan issue has become the focus of world attention, international food standards bodies of its hazards makes a few remarks, such as Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Agency: Sudan Red may increase the possibility of cancer of the test animals, but there is no evidence that sudan cause harm to humans, especially minor ingredients found in foods, their potential harm to the human body is extremely low and some domestic media centralized rebellion, and repeated speculation made Sudan red to the extreme, red to red to make people say, the point of involving red flustered. complementary to each other with strong contrast, some domestic scientists have long proposed, pickled smoked food carcinogenicity worse than sudan, but our media did not spend so much ink, layout and images of alert and warning pickled smoked food victimized This contrast is indeed puzzling. <br> In fact, the impact of the media on the public to this does not end the contrary exacerbate the past two days about how to KFC claims to KFC claims valid for 20 years and other similar reports flooded the newspapers and TV Internet, some media even egg or instigating people excesses Imagine 1300 KFC restaurants annually serve nearly 10 million people, and large-scale mass incidents provoke consequences how worthy conceived? Therefore, the media should reflect: We have to protect the public&#39;s right to know, how avoid public into inexplicable panic? advocate of the public to protect their legitimate rights and interests, and how science to guide, to tell the truth, the lifting of the public doubts? <br> sudan why red at the end? <br> thorough investigation of sudan, pursued relevant institutions and the responsibility of the persons, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and food regulatory authorities and epidemic prevention departments in the Sudan incident, praiseworthy, but still worthy of reflection at: First sudan vigilance and punished in the British Food Standards Agency on the consumption of food containing added sudan pigments to warn consumers, published on the website may contain Sudan Red list \"by the Chinese media reports, &#39;s response and action initiative some lag testing standards. Secondly, it is well known the KFC \"involving red food raw materials from its suppliers, suppliers suppliers down there, but the problem but has formed finished links that can be consumed directly found in the end of the most easily formed hurt the most, and not from the source, from the middle through a link Cha Du vulnerability of the problem and possible injury nipped in the bud consequences and contradictions are all about so that the end of business commitments, at least in terms of the negative impact this <br> the most important thing, which we should also hit and his, giving top priority to preventive work do ahead. said earlier, even more than the carcinogenicity of pickled smoked food in sudan, pickled smoked food production norms in law is still blank, we can legally prohibit the use of sudan sudan launched a thorough investigation of sudan action to develop a testing standards in the country, (lssjt.cn) we have no reason pickled smoked food drifted outside legal norms and government regulation? <br> sudan the red eternal pain? <br> According to media reports, due to the supply chain, the part of Kentucky on March 16 products ingredients sudan Kentucky has therefore become the first domestic the initiative exposes sudan problem and accept public oversight of multinational companies: the first time in the country to stop selling all the products in question, take the initiative to inform and apologize to consumers, always maintained transparency to the public, the support of the Government&#39;s comprehensive inventory and self-censorship after a series of rigorous scientific testing , after eight days, all involving KFC-red products have been approved by the national professional organization to confirm and the full restoration of the sale. <br> Needless to say, KFC has its own problems: too credulous suppliers, \"involving red\" foods may damage the health of consumers, and so on, but found the problem to this series of actions to solve the problem, we still see a multinational company&#39;s sense of responsibility and integrity, and the same was found sudan or loud Idealists, or muffled does not ring or stall the three manifestations of trouble compared to KFC frankly many, many honest; voluntarily recalling with car problems, KFC exposes, self-test, self-discipline, but also respect for the consumers of a positive attitude . (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> \"Food\", the Chinese government and people attach great importance to food safety issues in the food issue, KFC inadvertently has it tasted a lot of bitterness , but in turn over, (Lssdjt.com) we are not should also give it a more spacious space? <br> Yum Group brands KFC \"the Sudan incident\" announce the findings said strong supervision of government departments and community efforts to identify all the spices used in KFC flows. (history www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> Yum president Su, introduced sudan events after KFC conduct a comprehensive inspection of all may be involved in the seasoning, and fully cooperate with all levels of government for sampling in different cities, different spices, all testing work has been completed, you can be sure that all the problems spices from the macro Perfumery (Kunshan) limited two batches of chili powder. supplied to the Zhongshan-based Fife macro aromatic Company is a major supplier of professional seasoning. relevant departments are other flows to track down the source of the Sudan Red macro Fang and related products. <br> It is reported , KFC has been recycling all the restaurants and the seasoning of the distribution center, central depository to be destroyed in accordance with the standard procedures of internal waste disposal in accordance with the relevant requirements, with the government departments to properly handle at the same time, all alternative spices have completed production , and have been sent to the nationally recognized professional organizations to conduct a comprehensive inspection to confirm all spices are free of Sudan Red ingredients. March 22, the Beijing market recovery spicy chicken wings, spicy chicken burgers, the world&#39;s best chicken rice flower products sales; March 23, the country resumed sales Orleans roast wings <br> Yum said, to learn the lessons of the Sudan incident, decided to take three improvements: to strengthen the the original detection capability, investment of not less than 200 million to establish a modern food safety testing research center, which will be the first in the domestic food and beverage industry; requirements of all the major suppliers to increase staff, purchase of necessary testing equipment, feed all the necessary food safety sampling; strengthen current suppliers how to choose the required standard of upstream suppliers, to guard against the lack of law-abiding awareness can not adhere to the suppliers of the food safety mixed with the supply chain. <br> It is understood that KFC in China now has more than 1,300 restaurants. the (lsjt.org) ( People&#39;s Daily / Gong Wen) <br>'
