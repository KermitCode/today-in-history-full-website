'cont'=>'April 15, 1765 (, Yiyou leap February 26), the death of giant Lomonosov, Russian literature and the scientific community. died \"target =\" _blank \"> <br> Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov Lomonosov (1711 to 1765), the Russian chemist, philosopher . was born on November 19, 1711 °¢¶ûºº¸ñ¶ûË¹ Kaya the province ½ÜÄáË÷·ò¿¨ Village, April 15, 1765 and died in St. Petersburg in 1730, Moscow admitted to the Slavic - Greece - Latin School in 1735, he was transferred into the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, University of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1736 was sent to Germany to learn Mining first into the University of Marburg to study physics and chemistry, to Freiburg after learning of Mining and Metallurgy. back to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1741, he served as an associate professor of physics August 1745, the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and professor of chemistry. according to their own plans in the fall of 1748, he created the first chemical laboratory in Russia. founder of the Moscow State University in 1755. 1760 he was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1764 was elected the Academy of Sciences of Bologna, Italy. <br> because of his many contributions to the history of science in Russia, in particular, the law of conservation of mass and Russian grammar system editor, (lsjt.org) known as \"the history of science in Russia, Peter the Great \"<br> Lomonosov a knowledgeable scientists, Russian materialist philosophy and natural sciences founders. the scientific cosmology based on particulate philosophy. particles (molecules) by composed of tiny particles elements (atoms). firmly against the phlogiston theory was dominant and thermal Su said particle concepts to explain the phenomenon of heat, heat is the theory of the movement of the particles of the substance itself. 1748 the concept of conservation of matter and motion. experiments by heating the metal in a sealed container in 1756 to prove the law of conservation of mass applies to chemical reactions He also raised the gas kinetic theory, that the impact of the air particles on the wall air pressure. these theories laid the foundation for the development of theoretical chemistry in Russia, he first of these theories is called physical chemistry, these important results is not subject to international attention because Russia was far from the World Science Center . <br> Lomonosov founded the thermal dynamics in physics, said, pointing out that the hot substance on its own internal movement, essentially explain the phenomenon of thermal; proposed kinetic theory of gases that air the impact of the particles on the wall of the container is the result of air pressure; 1741, he founded the atomic part of the doctrine of the structure of matter, that the particles (molecules) is composed of tiny particles - (atomic), if the substance is composition with a particle, it is a simple substance; If the substance is composed by several different particles, is the compound, the nature of the substance is not formed by chance, it depends on the nature of the composition object microparticles ...... These The theory has laid the foundation for the development of Russia&#39;s physical chemistry. <br>'
