'cont'=>'September 15, 1928 (, Boshin August two days), Fleming invented penicillin. the <br> Fleming invented penicillin, to become one of the greatest contributions to the field of medicine <br> 1928 9 15, Alexander Fleming invented penicillin, which made him in full The world has won 25 honorary degrees, the 15 honorary citizenship of the city as well as more than 140 other honors, (l $ j¦Ó.c¨½) including the Nobel Prize in Medicine. <br> Alexander Fleming was a little Scot, he has a pair of piercing eyes, often tied bow tie on the collar. Per pupil read Fleming&#39;s legendary story - in a petri dish, he found that penicillin mold; technical difficulties to overcome a Road; expand long-term unremitting struggle with many skeptical final victory - the invention of penicillin became the greatest initiative in the 20th century, the medical profession. Decades, serious historians are still finishing his legend. Indeed, Fleming invented penicillin, but he does not realize what he found - that he knew nothing about. Later, two other scientists - Howard Florey and Ernst money grace from this discovery has been forgotten save fungi have a therapeutic effect, to prove the efficacy of penicillin, and This technology dedicated to human, began a tradition of the antibiotic era. the <br> Fleming from a poor farmer&#39;s son grow into educated renowned bacteriologist, almost all of his career in the hospital Â×¶ØÊ¥ÂêÀö engaged in bacteriological research. Him twice in the laboratory accident found that the story is well known. The first time in 1922, suffering from a cold, Fleming inadvertently front of the vessel of the culture of bacteria to sneezing; later he noticed., Petri dishes, where no bacteria stained sneeze mucus generated. With further research, Fleming discovered lysozyme - a soluble substance of bacteria found in the body fluids and body tissue. He thought that this may be the key to effective natural antibacterial agent. But he soon lost interest: Tests show that this lysozyme works only harmless microorganisms. God of luck come again in 1928. Fleming a vacation two weeks, one without brushing abandoned petri dishes to grow an amazing mold. Again, he observed the antibacterial effect of this fungus - bacteria covering all parts of the containers are not contaminated with this mold. However, this time the infection of the bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus, which is a serious, sometimes fatal infection source. This mold was also proven to be able to hinder the growth of a variety of other viral bacteria. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> penicillin (Fleming This mold is Penicillium selected the name) whether it is that he has long been looking for natural antibiotics? It is deposited in the wound on the effective fungicides? Further tests showed that, the role of this antibiotic is slow, and difficult to mass production. His enthusiasm will cool down. Before he moved on to other research projects, in a paper published in 1929, he introduced the above findings, but did not attract attention in this paper. Fleming Penicillin is an antibiotic, and nothing mentioned in the paper. He did not carry out the test of the observed effects of penicillin treatment system. To healthy rabbits and rats injected with bacterial culture liquid filtrate - toxicity test for penicillin, but never to the sick animals injected. If he was to do the test in this regard, such a \"wonder drug\" is likely to come out 10 years earlier. For [lsjt.net] <br> under the joint efforts of the British and American media, soon Fleming and unremitting struggle for the creation of a medical miracle legend was born. The (lsjt.net) <br> media in the history of science rarely commit such a stupid error. Fleming described the discovery of penicillin genius, and the research team of the University of Oxford is either made no mention, either over the area in just a few words. But in my lecture Fleming, he was always the birth of penicillin attributed Florey, Chain and his colleagues made. <br> Nobel Prize Committee not blinded by the public opinion of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded Fleming one. Fleming collaborators the Florey and money grace he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. <br> Alexander Fleming died in 1955, aged 74 years. Correction view biographers and historians who promptly wrote the true story about the of Penicillin invention process. However, those mythical legend difficult to forget. Encyclopedia Britannica still recorded most of the content on the legend of Fleming. cause urethritis <br> E. coli, without medication the situation <br> and the penicillin contact cell wall began shortly after a period of uplift <br> growing period, uplift part, so that the cell membrane excessively swell expansion <br> cell membrane rupture and cell death <br>'
