'cont'=>'(, October 25 BingXu), December 15, 2006, the Earth King geomagnetic storms. <br> 2006 12 15, the Earth King geomagnetic storms. <br> National Space Weather Monitoring and Warning Center said in a report released on the 15th, the 15th King geomagnetic storms on Earth, the evening of 16 possible resurgence of large magnetic storms, magnetic storms on communications, navigation systems in satellites and on Earth may have some impact. <br> According to the researcher at the National Satellite Meteorological Center Space Weather chamber music precious Ming broke out in Beijing at 10:40 on the 13th X3.4-class solar flare and associated coronal mass ejections (CME) CME reach the Earth Earth King geomagnetic storm in the early morning of the 15th. <br> Beijing time at 6:15 on the 15th and the outbreak of an X1.5-class solar flare, the same with the CME. The solar flares affect solar energetic proton flux again increased the proton event is expected to be the end of late on the 15th or the 16th. CME may reach the Earth on the evening of 16, at which time there may be large storm again. <br> music you say so, large magnetic storms can change the posture of the man-made Earth satellite, such that it can change the direction of the satellite remote sensor probe. Large magnetic storms can also affect the positioning, navigation and short-wave communications, but generally does not affect the phone. Additional current generated by the large storm will have some impact on the power system. In addition, a large storm, flying pigeons get lost can not go home, because the the pigeons flying along the magnetic field lines, large storm will change the direction of the magnetic field lines. <br> Comments: cosmic wonders! <br>'
