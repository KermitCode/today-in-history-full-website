'cont'=>'(Gengwu June 20), July 15, 1930, the American mathematician Stephen Smale was born. Stephen Smale, <br> Stephen Smale <br> (July 15, 1930) is an American mathematician, winner of the Fields Medal in 1966. Due to the stock the Poincare conjecture over the five-dimensional or fame. Then turned to the study dynamical systems, made important achievements also outlines a research program to implement to many researchers. Smale also for mathematical economy, recently also explore different computational theory. <br> 1998 Smale lists the 18 math problems of the 21st century, mentally followed the 1900 Hilbert math problem. The Smale problems part of the mathematical problem of Hilbert. The problem has not resolved the Jacobian conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis. <br> Smale another famous theorem, is proved spherical eversion Smale paradox. This paradox is that if they permit through the own spherical, spherical inner wall to turn out without wrinkles. <br> Smale received his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1957, and has taught at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley. 1995 after the retirement of the Berkeley City University of Hong Kong, and now as a professor. An asteroid discovered in 1982 in recognition of his contribution in 2000 to him to name. <br>'
