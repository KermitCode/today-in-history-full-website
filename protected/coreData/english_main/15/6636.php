This is necessary to put it most understand that the most unambiguous, Marx and Engels. Far in 1847, Marx and Engels in the \"Communist Manifesto,\" drafted to assert that \"proletarian motherland\", shouted the slogan \"the world proletariat unite!\" Since then, their thoughts and struggles saturated with this spirit of internationalism. The (history today www.lssdjt.com) <br> to 1864, this international spirit first manifested as forms of organization. This year, the workers&#39; representatives of the four countries of Britain, France and Italy met in London, the resolutions of the creation of the \"International Working Men&#39;s Ð­»á\" for groups of workers contacted authorities in Asian countries. The literal translation of the name of the new group for the international workers&#39; associations, where \"international\" word as an adjective to use. That is, the meaning of the \"Britain, France and Italy Association of Asian countries workers. Marx on behalf of the German workers to participate in the work of this new group, gradually guide the entire organization to the idea of &#8203;&#8203;scientific socialism. <br> Marx is the founder and leader of the Association, and many important documents of the drafting of the Declaration on the establishment and temporary articles of incorporation for the association, the Association&#39;s mission is to unite the workers of all countries, the struggle for the complete liberation of the working class and destroy any class rule.

The club name is too long, people will have to take its word, referred to as the \"International\" (international) and later became a habit, the entire group is called \"First International\". This is the first time, the adjective into a noun. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) <br> first international since its inception, under the leadership of Marx, Engels, and a variety of opportunistic resolute struggle. Which anarchist Proudhon&#39;s struggle is once the largest and most far-reaching struggle. September <br> 1866, the first international first congress was held in Geneva to participate in the General Assembly on behalf of the first international 22 branch and 11 other workers groups, a total of 60 people. French Proudhon confrontation with the International Committee, sent a large delegation composed of 17. Attempt to rely on safety in numbers, to the Proudhon view imposed to the General Assembly, in order to achieve its tampering with the nature and mission of the international conspiracy. To this end, they arrogantly to the General Assembly a total of ten principles of the \"Memorandum of Understanding\". Memorandum, they openly peddle Proudhon opposed the strike, opposed to the emancipation of women, against the proletarian revolution against the fallacy of the national liberation movement, the proletariat Proudhon liberation dogma preached by the establishment of cooperatives and other peaceful means. <br> Marx finalized in the first volume of \"Das Kapital\", not spare participation in the Geneva Conference, but Marx foresaw the General Assembly will have a fierce struggle, so pre-written \"Provisional Central Committee in respect of certain indicated problems to representatives, as the correct resolution of the main agenda of the General Assembly. Provisions in the \"instructions\" in the strikes, the workers of all countries should treat each other with mutual support: 8-hour working slogan; determine the direction of development and the revolutionary tasks of the trade unions and cooperatives; advocate the inclusion of women and children to participate in social productive labor; support an important part of the national liberation struggle. Marx clearly pointed out in the \"instructions\" cooperation system \"transformation of capitalist society\" must not, and must rely on the proletariat to grasp armed, violent revolution. Thus, Marx believed that: \"on behalf of the General Assembly should not announce any special cooperation system. Congress in Geneva, the support of the representatives of the international routes to Marx \"indicates\" weapons, and the Proudhonist by tit-for-tat struggle through the correct resolution, Marxism achieved a major victory! <br> 1871 worker revolts in Paris, the French branch of the First International not only participate, but to occupy a leadership position. Can the Paris Commune failed, First International was a heavy blow, plus outside bourgeois government banned within the petty-bourgeois ideological offensive, the tension, the organizational strength day by day weakness. First international since the 1872 Hague Congress has virtually ceased activities. Therefore, on July 15, 1876, according to Marx&#39;s recommendations, and finally in Philadelphia on behalf of meeting announced the dissolution of the First International. Marx led the International Workers &#39;Association \"in the history of the workers&#39; movement is known as the\" First International \", as distinct from the several international organizations of workers. <br> First International is an important stage in the struggle of Marx and Engels for countries to establish a proletarian party. <br>'
