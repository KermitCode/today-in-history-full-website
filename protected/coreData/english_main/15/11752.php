'cont'=>'December 15, 1989 (of Baba the winter months XVIII), signed by the four Lom¨¦. In December 1989, after long and arduous negotiations, the EC-12 and the 68 countries of Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific on Dec. 15 signed in the Togolese capital four Lom¨¦ . \" Under this agreement, the EC in the next five years will be non-plus too signatory countries to provide a total of 12 billion European currency units (about 13.2 billion U.S. dollars) in grants and concessional loans. Agreement with effect from February 1990. This is a north-south countries signed an important economic and trade agreements. <br> compared with the first three agreements signed atmosphere, the enthusiasm of the ACP countries have been greatly diminished. Eyadema, President of the host country in his speech strongly urge the EC not to improve relations with some countries to the detriment of the interests of the old friends. He proposed to convene a meeting of the EC and the ACP countries, the ACP countries in order to discuss the development of an established in the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations and the largest market in Europe in 1992 assistance and compensation measures. He said: \"As long as a few people hold most of the wealth on this planet make most people plunged into a state of poverty and dependence, there would be no real peace in the world\". Third World countries&#39; debt burden, the terms of trade to deteriorate, unemployment and inflation pressure, out of breath, and this is the real danger. \"<br>\" Lom¨¦ \"economic and trade agreements between the EC countries and the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean, the Pacific, these developing countries in the past many of the British and French colonies. Agreement signed by the first time on February 28, 1975, signed in Lome, Togo, Lom¨¦. The Agreement is valid for five years, the two renewed agreements expire in October 1979 and December 1984. The provisions of the Agreement, the EC should give preferential treatment to ACP countries to promote industrialization, financial and technical assistance, tariff and stable export earnings. The amount of assistance for the first three agreements were 3.5 billion, 5.607 billion and 85 billion European Currency Unit. These payments in addition to directly fund development projects in ACP countries, a considerable part devoted to the stability of the primary products of the ACP countries export income. (Lssjt.cn) <br> Admittedly, these measures have played a certain role in helping ACP countries to overcome economic difficulties, and to reduce the loss of their export earnings. However, due to the lack of stable income subsidies total, often can not meet the requirements of the exporting country apply for subsidies. In 1988, for example, the ACP countries of tropical crops such as coffee and cocoa prices plummeted, EC subsidies to 579 million European Currency Unit, but the actual approval of only 375 million European Currency Unit. Another example, (lssjt.cn) C&#244;te d&#39;Ivoire, the loss of export earnings in 1988 to 600 billion CFA francs, get subsidies of 40 billion CFA francs. It is because of the irrational international economic order between 1980 and 1987, the purchasing power of the ACP countries fell by 64%, the gap is widening between the north and the south. <br> view of the first three Lom¨¦ did not prevent the pauperization of the ACP countries, so that it took to the healthy and stable development of the road, these Third World countries on four Lom¨¦ high hopes. They had asked that the the EC increased financial assistance, and funds to improve the stability of export earnings, and to reform the existing Stabex relax the restrictions compensation. Despite the assistance of the agreement amount is significantly higher than the previous three, however, due to the reasonable request of the ACP countries has not been a serious discussion and treat, and some even have been flatly refused, resulting in ACP countries generally disappointed. The \"fraternity Morning in <br> C&#244;te d&#39;Ivoire in a signed article pointed out that\" the cooperation of the EC and the ACP countries is the combination of each other&#39;s interests, since cooperation from the contract since both derive benefits. The question now is non-ACP countries has been compromised. \"Senegal commerce minister called on to say:\" The matter is very clear, the EC is able to put forward a reform program to lift people&#39;s worries That depends on whether it is truly sincere. \"<br>'
