'cont'=>'December 15, 1999 (Spring winter and early eight), the heart of Louis XVII was sent to Paris for genetic analysis. <br> the the heart <br> in crystal bottle Louis XVII 1999 December 15, 2010, in the heart of Louis XVII in crystal bottle will be sent to a laboratory in Paris, France to do DNA testing. to unravel the mystery of his life. (History 1795 cn) <br>, died in a prison in Paris that the 10-year-old boy, is not the son of King Louis XVI of France? Awful wrapped around people 200 years the koan finally concluded on April 19:. <br> awful koan merits twists and turns, and made people two hundred years today. Now, finally solved the mystery gene analysis rely on modern technology. (L $ j¦Ó.c¨½) <br> As we all know, the last monarch of the French Revolution before the Bourbon Louis XVI, the Revolution, he sent to the guillotine in 1793, near the queen went out to him. At the time, their son (known as \"Louis 17\") is imprisoned in the the Paris Knights Templar monastery prison, June 8, 1795, therefore bone tuberculosis. Originally, the story of the little prince this end, however Shortly after his death, appears rumors, says his successful escape, stealth abroad, the boy died of illness in prison is a \"stand-in\". Early 1800s, turned out to smoke more than 100 \"Louis XVII. Which named Wei He Lyme Rudolf Prussia watchmaker, he play more pool, and finally even the members of the Bourbon family also blindfolded him. He died in 1845, seems to bore this inscription on the tombstone: \"Here the security lying Louis 17 Duke of Normandy, France and Noval King. \"<br> Then, that the boy died in prison in the end is not Louis XVII? 1846 had opened autopsy. Then the second day of his death, the forensic report said, the deceased was suffering from bone tuberculosis, watching from the body of 10-year-old. The results of this autopsy, the deceased was suffering from bone tuberculosis from the body, and the ages of 15-18 years old. 1894 and another autopsy infer become older, say 18-20 years. Therefore, only two possibilities: either he was not Louis XVII, either error-checking of the body (he was buried in a public funeral ditch). <br> later to watchmaker Rudolf also exposed the flaws, it was found that there are a lot of inconsistencies in his autobiography, his coffin was opened in 1950, to remove the sample from the remains of the right humerus. 1990s, genetic analysis technology maturity 1993 (1 $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m). Rudolf humerus sampling given respectively to the two laboratories in Belgium and France, their respective genetic analysis of mitochondrial sample . In view of this mitochondrial genetic mother, the researchers will it with taken from Louis XVII mother, Queen Marie Antoinette hair samples were compared. A monastery in Austria also retained the queen two sisters hair. Gene contrasting conclusions: Rudolf kinship has nothing to do with the queen. <br> Rudolf scam was exposed, but still insufficient to prove that the death in prison of Louis XVII, the gene needs to be done to further the contrast. Well, from where to extract his genes? Fortunately, his heart is still preserved. Louis XVII died <br> the day, the remains do anatomy, four doctors participating in the anatomy. One called Philip - Jean Peile Tan, he was taking advantage of three colleagues do not pay attention, secretly remove the heart to hand, it rolled into the ground chaff. He later with a handkerchief wrapped, put it into his pocket, put one filled with crystal bottle of alcohol in the home. Peile Tan heart to the Bourbon family has repeatedly tried, but failed. In two years, 1828, before his death, the heart to the Paris Archbishop government, Archbishop said he would keep to the then the reign of King Charles X. <br> 1830, revolution broke out in Paris. On July 29, the revolutionary masses attacked the bishop&#39;s. Disarray, a typographer snatched Fengyun heart, to give Peile Tan&#39;s son. This is another saw, and competition among, crystal bottle fell to the ground and broke. August 5, the situation returned to calm, Peile Tan&#39;s son came to the bishop&#39;s really lucky, they find a heart in the sand pile and the broken crystal bottle. <br> 1895, the heart to the claiming rightful heirs of the French royal family the Archduke Don Carlos of Madrid. In 1975, the Grand Duke&#39;s granddaughter cardiac forwarded to the French the Memorial Committee Xibaofumeng Grand Duke. Subsequently, Louis Prince of Bourbon royal parents and the identity of the heir to the throne, requires the State to the heart of Louis XVII was buried beside their parents. Since then, the Fengyun after suffering the heart has been kept in the Basilique Saint-Denis is the burial place of the kings of France. either from the Fengyun cardiac, sampling few years before <br>, there is controversy. Moreover, the heart has been two hundred years twice rolled into soil, it has no mitochondrial genes? However, this is the only way to reveal the truth. December 15, 1999, several doctors were invited to the catacombs of St. Denis. The heart has already become very hard, they had to draw the saw and took 4 samples, Belgium and Germany, the two professors were elucidated. April 19, 2000, the Bourbon royal family following a bit man Louis Prince and the two professors officially announced: The boy died in Paris Knights Templar monastery prison in 1795 is indeed Louis XVII, and not a substitute. <br> France was the 1994 legislation that would allow for the purpose of medical, scientific and judicial application of genetic analysis, the end of 1999, will also establish the genetic code of the sex offender card. The United States is the application of this technology is the most extensive country, and has to take to save the lives of eight death row inmates. <br> dust for many years due to the rapid development of gene technology, the case file to be re-heard. In the 1980s, eastern France, the case with the vicious killing of young children, have been hearing for years, difficult judgments. April 19, 2000, announced the results of genetic tests that Louis XVII same day, prosecutors requested a rehearing, the reason is that the murderer of anonymous letters still preserved, he put stamps with saliva is enough to identify the gene ultimately solve the case of the great possibility. <br>'
