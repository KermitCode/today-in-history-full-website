'cont'=>'(Awake, May 19), June 27, 1994, the space junk threatening space station construction. <br> U.S. Aerospace Secretary Daniel - June 1994 Golding said, \"garbage\" will hinder human space activities for 30 years in the space left by the manned space flight, proposed as a scientific research The base for the construction of the space station can not fail to take measures to this. <br> space \"junk\" failed satellite, multi-level space rocket wreckage and other debris, which the largest ground can be observed with a bus rather, quite the smallest with a softball, quantity about 7,000 blocks, but also increased the rate of 2-5 percent per year. <br> space \"junk\" is a pre-existing problem. In general, the larger the volume of the spacecraft, the longer flight time, the greater the risk tolerance. With the space station as the long stay in space compared to the existing U.S. space shuttle is very small, the flight time is only a few days or ten days, but has been changed to avoid the \"junk\" fragments flying posture. <br> Since 1984, the then U.S. President Ronald Reagan for the first time announced the space station construction program, the space station design has been revised many times the volume of the space station after the completion of the proposed than originally designed about 40% larger.
