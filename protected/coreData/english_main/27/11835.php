'cont'=>'December 27, 1984 (JiaZi winter and the beginning of six), the scientists cooperation in the artificial comet scientific experiments. <br> joint research projects at a cost of $ seventy-eight million, according to the United States, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, the three countries, the Federal Republic of Germany, a satellite around half past four in the morning on December 27, 1984 (Pacific Standard Time) Pacific 60,000 miles above the ground to release the cloudy the metal barium to produce an effect similar to the comet&#39;s celestial phenomenon - artificial comet. Observation aircraft soon observed the emergence of a small comet heads and tails. <br> this experiment is one of the seven experiments Three joint research project, originally scheduled for two days before cloudy sky in Arizona, New Mexico and Hawaii, these areas will affect ground-based observations of artificial comet postponed. <br> scientists hope that through this study to gain insight into the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth&#39;s magnetic field; space plasma and dust and gas from the collision of comets, planets and star formation; how to control the plasma generated by nuclear fusion energy; solar wind how to interfere with the satellite and the Earth&#39;s communications and power lines, as well as how to affect the Earth&#39;s weather. The astronomers also intends to use the Fengyun artificial comet to adjust the equipment at the end of 1985 to early 1986 to study Halley&#39;s Comet. <br> the Fengyun artificial comet rely on the sun&#39;s energy issued shade. In vast areas of the western United States and Hawaii, Canada, southwest and central Pacific, Tahiti and other places, it is a clear night with the naked eye observation it ten minutes, and the telescope can be observed one hour. <br>'
