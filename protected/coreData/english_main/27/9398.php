She believes that the potential of trade and investment between Asia and Europe is not yet into full play, should make full use of the existing channels of cooperation, and actively carry out fruitful cooperation. <br> Wu pointed out that \"only the establishment of trade and investment cooperation between Asia and Europe on the basis of mutual respect, accepting differences, seek common ground while reserving differences, take a realistic attitude, in order to achieve tangible results. Too much emphasis on concerted and unified action is unrealistic. <br> Wu Yi stressed that both Asia and Europe in the future in the field of trade and investment cooperation should follow the following principles: First, equality and mutual benefit, mutual respect. Process to promote trade and cooperation, it is necessary to take into account the interests of the member states of the different levels of development, and take practical action to embody the principle of balance of interests. Secondly, the principle of non-discrimination. ASEM member countries in the fields of trade and investment to take any incentives should unconditionally equal implementation of the other member states as well as non-ASEM member. The existing discriminatory trade practices and investment barriers should be abolished as soon as possible. Third, step-by-step, pragmatic. Recommend starting with differences less work to start trade and investment facilitation, cooperation, and gradually eliminate all the barriers and obstacles that hinder the normal development of trade and investment of the two regions, and ultimately achieve the purpose of promoting trade and capital flows. [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> Wu said, between Asia and Europe trade and investment flows have been of considerable size, there is a huge potential for future development, but discrimination still exists due to some members&#39; internal trade barriers, between members of the normal trade order by vandalism. These trade barriers if they continue to exist, will seriously affect the in-depth development of the Asia-Europe trade and investment cooperation. She suggested that hinder the development of trade and investment barriers on members exist within regular consultations and exchange of views, deepen understanding, in order to remove the obstacles as soon as possible. <br>'
