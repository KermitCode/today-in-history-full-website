'cont'=>'March 27, 1996 (Rat-, February ninth day), hepatitis G virus is found in our population. , <br> 1996 3 27, reported People&#39;s Hospital, Beijing Medical University Institute of Liver Diseases application of gene diagnosis technology, recently in our individual donors, the blood of patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis patients, for the first time found HGV hepatitis virus \"target =\" _blank \"> hepatitis G virus infection, show that the new type of hepatitis research of prevention and treatment in China made significant progress. <br> quite a long time, can confirm the diagnosis of hepatitis virus A, B, C, D and E 5, which cause chronic hepatitis and severe liver damage is both hepatitis B and C viruses, and advocated the adoption of a blood-borne. because of widespread use of sensitive and specific diagnostic reagents for the detection, has been able to better control of these viruses spread through blood, through clinical clear diagnosis of 80%. However, the other 20% of the patients with chronic hepatitis and post-transfusion hepatitis has not been identified hepatitis drug indicators known description certainly there are other unknown hepatitis virus infection exists <br> the second half of 1995 to January 1996, the two laboratories in the United States have issued a non-A to the new hepatitis E virus gene sequences, it preliminary named G (China called Geng) hepatitis virus (HGV) this virus, hepatitis C virus, the route of transmission, pathogenicity and hepatitis C virus can exist for a long time in the body. <br> ; recently, Beijing Medical University, People&#39;s Hospital, Institute of Liver Diseases, the blood supply to the crowd of more than two hundred cases in northern China, found that 8% of hepatitis G virus carriers. confirmed by the relevant sequence analysis, they in A to E all negative signs of hepatitis virus in patients with chronic hepatitis, also found in the serum of patients with cirrhosis of hepatitis G virus This result suggests that blood transfusion is an important way to spread hepatitis G virus; This virus caused by chronic hepatitis play an important role, probably China Following Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C virus the third roughly chronic liver virus <br> as soon as possible to reduce and control the spread of HGV liver virus had the 1970s developed the first of hepatitis B diagnostic reagents for the Study of Liver Diseases, recently developed hepatitis G virus gene diagnostic reagents and has begun to be applied in clinical validation. <br>'
