The four figures appeared on the stage, with three people - two women and a man locked in a room and wait for death. The gist of this one-act play can be summed up in one sentence: \"the other is hell\" <br> 36-year-old Sartre last year to a book of his \"Being and Nothingness\" suddenly appeared in the literary arena.
