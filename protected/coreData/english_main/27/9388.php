'cont'=>'September 27, 1988 (Boshin August 17) I nuclear submarine underwater launch vehicle successfully. <br> 1988 27, China launch vehicle testing to target sea area all over (September 14). The test launch vehicle, developed by China&#39;s own nuclear submarine underwater launch rockets accurately splashed down in the target sea area, the whole trial was a complete success. September 28, 1988, \"People&#39;s Daily\" published a lengthy communication \"Birth of a Chinese nuclear submarine\" chronicles this launch and nuclear submarines developed situation. (L $ j而.c里) wrote: <br> missile submarine launch vehicle success marks the sophisticated technology of China&#39;s national defense and jump to a new level, the Chinese government has long declared: China will never be a superpower, but also has no intention to participate in the arms race in the world. (L $ dj而.妨壯T) we developed missile submarines, in order to defend the peace. late <br> 50, Marshal Nie strategist courage and foresight to the CPC Central Committee report it, China wants to develop nuclear submarines. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) When Deng Xiaoping, general secretary of the report forwarded to the Chairman and the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, the only photos of the two foreign submarines shape of the hands of our scientists. However, Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, and Defense Minister Peng Dehuai immediately approved the report. At that time, a time when China&#39;s talks with the top leaders of the countries concerned, we propose to each other to provide the relevant technical information. The other one refused to believe that China&#39;s industrial base, technical strength and scientific level do not have the minimum conditions simply can be done. Chairman Mao Zedong unbelievers (the Today TodayOnHistory.com history) under a determination: \"a thousand years of nuclear submarines also wants to come out! \"<br> Construction of nuclear submarines, the best talent together. Zhezhi technology team, physicist, shipbuilding experts, a nuclear reactor expert, rocket scientist; Boxer Indemnity to send out to study the return of the late Qing Dynasty student; the KMT period melancholy difficult Exhibition intelligent scholars; just took off his military uniform. the new intellectuals; quick school trained the top students in the Republic of the initial sessions of graduating from college. Really elites Oh! <br> they began an arduous journey. The most rudimentary conditions and the most state-of-the-art technology blend, to specific links these two points is the scientific and technical personnel dedication and spirit of sacrifice. In the long years of the difficult environment, the hardships, the situation changes, can not be shaken their original intention for the development of nuclear submarines and devotion. the <br> Chinese nuclear submarine not only embodied the hard work of hundreds of scientists, hundreds of boat builders, hundreds of sailors to pay for it, also embodied more than 20 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and more than 2000 factories Institute for the price paid. <br> One expert told us such a touching thing: there are more than 20 researchers from across the country come together, to assume the task of the development of the nuclear submarine missile launchers. Their arduous journey, the ups and downs, and finally come up with the international advanced level missile launchers. How many nuclear submarines developed like special fuel developer of such well-known and nameless people who can not statistics. The only thing we know, more than 20 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and thousands of scientific research units, factories took part in the development work; know, almost every research and development units should encounter the high quality requirements, the production of a small number of little profit, even unprofitable as well as a loss, but who refused. Many factories in the era of civil unrest stoppages stop factory, but a nuclear submarine project mission statement can workers reclaim workshop ...... <br> nuclear submarine inspired our national cohesion, national cohesion was born the nuclear submarine! <br> launch vehicle, accurate splashdown of good news quickly returned to the command post hall. A Shuangbin Feishuang scientific and technological workers in the hall, this good news with excitement can not own. Walked up to him surrounded warmly congratulate him to ...... <br> he called Huang Xuhua, is the chief architect of China&#39;s nuclear submarines. Huang in total this year, 62-year-old, his later life and our nuclear submarines developed closely linked together, and made an important contribution to its birth. The early 1960s, he was appointed as the deputy chief engineer of the Institute of nuclear submarines overall since the huge amount of work in the development of pressure on his shoulders. Collaborative research meeting he presided; design argument he wants the final say; the highly sophisticated difficulties he was going to \"rescue\" ...... critical juncture in the development work, he had consecutive warriors, not board the whole year house, Colleagues called \"flying\". <br> as chief designer Huang Xuhua solve the developed difficult issue with extraordinary courage and wisdom of people plagued by difficult, he always puts everybody from the mountain heavy water complex \"introduce\" a way out \". such a vast <br> nuclear submarine systems engineering, requires very careful scheduling, time, engineering was anxious, many projects edge design and construction, the overall final design, a calculation of the weight of the boat gradually inflated boats balanced adversely affected. People brains. Huang Xuhua widely to listen to our views on the basis of decision-making, so a nuclear submarine smooth groundwater submerged. <br> called the chief architect of China&#39;s \"father of the nuclear submarine\", but he denied that: \"the development of the nuclear submarine, I only own posts trying to do should do. \"Then, with his hand pointing beside Peng Shilu, Zhao Kai, yellow Weilu, Chan Tak Yan and other scientists and research and design staff, said:\" To say that the father of the nuclear submarine, they are regarded. \"<br>, The agony and sweat of the birth of the Chinese nuclear submarine technology workers, is the parent of China&#39;s nuclear submarines. China precisely because of such a large number of scientific and technological workers, in the field of cutting-edge technology into the world out. We are proud of such a large number of scientific and technological workers. <br>'
