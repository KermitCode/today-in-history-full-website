'cont'=>'(Rat years of the twelfth lunar month 19), January 27, 1997, U.S. scientists create atom laser. 1 <br> 1997 27, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist According to quantum theory, the first time in the history of human sciences with sodium atoms to produce some similar characteristics with the ordinary photon laser atom laser, which an experiment caused a sensation in the world of physics. The the <br> \"science\" and \"Physical Review Letters\" two academic journals reported this outcome. Atom laser with ordinary laser manufactured by Dr. Wolfgang Keitel and colleagues similarities their particles are coherent the ordinary laser photon coherent atom laser generates coherent atom. Atom laser is not like ordinary laser as through the air, but this coherent pulsations atomic beam will be used to make milli micro lines and other nanostructured, and can be used to make ultra-fine measurement system. Dr. <br> Keitel and five colleagues wrote in the journal \"Science\", the first experiment using ordinary laser and magnetic fields sodium atom gas is cooled to near absolute zero (minus 273 degrees Celsius), so that the atoms speed and momentum close to zero, and then create two drops each containing one million atoms Bose - Einstein condensate. <br> they laser cut, photographed with a special camera equipment in 1996 and the early morning of November 16, 2011 3 coherent resemblance to intersect two drops of condensate in the vacuum state in the world for the first time to create the atom laser. [L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m] <br> here the experts pointed out that, 37 years ago, ordinary laser was invented, who can not imagine that it will have such a wide range of uses; MIT scientists found that in addition to the physics great significance, the actual use of the potential value. <br>'
