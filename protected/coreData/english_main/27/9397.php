The Taliban fighters <br> September <br> 1996 27 morning patrol in the streets of Kabul, the Afghan students armed Taliban siege Kabul for up to 11 months old, was eventually overcome. Check Kabul by the Taliban, on the one hand, the rapid establishment of their own political institutions, set up a six-member committee headed by by Mo Erwei - Rabbani, officially took over the capital city of the various government departments, the management of the implementation of Islamic law on the capital; the other hand, in the military not give the opponent a respite, continue non-stop to hunt down the Rabbani and Masood leadership, government forces and pushed to the Panjshir Valley. the <br> Kabul changed hands, the situation in Afghanistan worsened, attracted worldwide attention and became the focus of international media attention and talk of recent times. the <br> \"troubled times Hero the Taliban <br> Taliban, virtually unknown before 1994. However, since the second half of that year, this student military rapid rise, forming a 40,000 armed political and armed groups of more than 10 fighters and more than 200 tanks. Currently, it has occupied the 18 provinces of the country&#39;s 31 provinces, accounting for about 70% of the land area. The rise of the Taliban legendary, but a review of 16 years of war in Afghanistan, especially the past four years the civil war facts, understand that it is not heaven, but a product of the civil war in Afghanistan. the retreat and anti-Su armed <br> invasion Asu Jun in the spring of 1992, after the seizure of power, millions of Afghan refugees eager to return home, to enjoy the long life of hope for peace and tranquility. But each area of &#8203;&#8203;the factions of armed groups is king, big civil war as a struggle for power, causing a greater loss than the anti-Soviet struggle. The majority of refugees are still not return to the country, and dare not normalized. Especially young people see no future, strong dissatisfaction with the size of the armed leader of those who adhere to the civil war. In July 1994, stationed in Kandahar city, the Islamic Party, Xi Kema Tia send a regional commander led a group of soldiers of fortune Sichuangminzhai, looting of property and rape the women, sparking abnormal anger of the general public. 35-year-old Maulavi - Mohammed - Omar is a local priest, who fought bravely in the struggle against the Soviets, and injured four times, in quite the prestige of the masses. He led a group of Islamic students wiped them partners disturbing officers and men, so popular big fast stand out. But Islamic Party, not only did not draw a lesson from, contrary even to arrest people attractiveness. Omar and others were forced to transfer to Pakistan immediately after the combination of Afghan refugees in the Islamic students, and in October of the same year, the establishment of the Taliban, Mullah Omar was elected as the Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Afghan border city of Quetta. Coincides with the beginning of November, (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) Pakistan is a bound for Central Asia&#39;s foreign trade army in the city of Kandahar, Afghanistan, the Islamic party&#39;s armed seizure, the Taliban will take the opportunity to play back home, after several rounds of fighting, not only to rescue fleet and expand the team, occupied the whole of Kandahar City. Then, the Taliban bang captured the 12 provinces of the Islamic Party control of the southeast, the gates of Kabul. <br> situation became the intricate <br> Taliban this a great victory weather, geography and a variety of factors, but the regime itself has many limitations. Taliban has a strong fundamentalist thinking, after the capture of Kabul, it is announced that the full implementation of Islamic law, women must be religious clothing and masked men must grow beards; Close all theater and television; theft by amputation and stoning adulterers dead, etc., will be severely punished for violation of the law. Said that the Islamic law declared the day there are two women&#39;s dress code does not meet the requirements to be punished. Especially after the Taliban student army captured Kabul, seize refuge in the United Nations in Afghanistan offices of former President Najibullah, hanged and violence dead on the streets in public. These excesses by the international community, especially by the Russian opposition support the Rabbani government. The Iranian government that the Taliban captured Kabul, does not contribute to the political settlement of the Afghan issue. Pakistan and the United States, starting from its own strategic and economic interests, and support the Taliban came to power. <br> placed in front of the Taliban regime, the most important issue is how to obtain the recognition of the international community. From a military point of view, although the Taliban has Rabbani and Masood-led government forces in fierce Panjshir Valley, but everyone knows, the Valley is easy to defend and difficult to attack strategic places, doing all the original Soviet wanton abuse fried for 10 years and did not win, the Taliban in order to wipe out this army seems to be extremely difficult. <br> Taliban during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan President Najibullah and his brother hanged <br> after the Taliban came to power, the extreme fundamentalist require women to have the gown will bind tightly, even the the eyes <br> in banned western region play movies, TV and temperance, Taliban fighters are being saved a cinema movie public destruction of the Taliban-controlled <br> the women dress <br> area'
