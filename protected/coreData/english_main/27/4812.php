'cont'=>'May 27, 1996, April 11 (Rat), China&#39;s largest offshore oil field in full production. <br> seven first in the world, China&#39;s largest offshore oil field development and production technology as leading level 11 - 1 Liuhua oilfield put into the ceremony held in Beijing on May 27, 1996. the <br> Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Zou Jiahua met with the chairman of Amoco attend the celebration, Mr. Fuller and Mr. McPherson, chairman of Kerr-McGee, expressed his warm congratulations to the production of the oilfield. the <br> Liuhua oil field is jointly developed by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and the United States Amoco and Kerr-McGee Oil, which is located 190 kilometers southeast of Hong Kong waters over 300 m water depth, geological oil reserves of about 200 million tons, peak annual output of up to 250 million tons, which is by far China&#39;s largest offshore oilfield Sino-foreign cooperative, the total investment of the project is $ 620 million. <br> Liuhua oil field was discovered in 1987, because it is located in the deepwater and typhoon-prone areas, the sea conditions are extremely bad, coupled with the unfavorable factors of crude oil viscous, formation pressure small, rare in the world to make this oilfield development difficulty. Engineering team from 1987 to 1992, by the South China Sea, Eastern Oil Company and Amoco experts have carried out many experiments and explorations, and finally achieved many breakthroughs, to find the original development plan. According to experts at home and abroad, the Liuhua oilfield development and construction, using the latest technology developed by many of the oil and gas industry equipment, represents the highest level of the world&#39;s offshore oil and gas development projects. Special in subsea wellhead production system, the oil field has created seven world first: the first round in the largest oil field in more than 20 wells using horizontal wells; subsea horizontal christmas tree first; first application of electric submersible pump technology set oil the subsea wellhead production system. <br>'
