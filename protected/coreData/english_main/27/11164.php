'cont'=>'November 27, 1701 October 28 (Government House), the Swedish astronomer Anders camera Seoul Hughes was born. <br> Anders camera Seoul Hughes (Swedish: Anders the Celsius, 1701 November 27, 2011 -1744 years 25 days), a Swedish astronomer. Photo Seoul Hughes was born in Uppsala, Sweden. (L $ dj¦Ó.c¨­m) in 1730-1744 the Ren Ruidian Uppsala University astronomy professor, from 1732 to 1735 have visited Germany, Italy and France over the significant astronomical observatory. <br> he published in Nuremberg in 1733, he and others in 1716-1732, $ 316 Aurora observation. In Paris he advocated to measure the length of an arc of the meridian of Lapland and the French Academy of Sciences in 1736 to participate in the preparations for the expedition for this purpose. <br> camera Seoul Hughes, founder of the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741, in a paper to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1742, and the Celsius temperature scale. Original his thermometer based on the boiling point of water is 0 degrees, and the freezing point as compared to 100 degrees. Later, the temperature scale in 1745 by Carl Linnaeus its upside down and has been in use ever since. <br> Anders camera Seoul Matthews is used in the fields of science and published a careful experiment in order to define the international temperature scale first person. He reported in his papers published in Swedish \"observation\" two continuous degrees on the thermometer, check the freezing point of water experiment has nothing to do with the latitude (or atmospheric pressure). He determined the relationship between the boiling point of water with atmospheric pressure (very much in line with the modern data). He was also given a boiling point with the law if the air pressure is not the same measurement with a standard air pressure. <br> 1744, he died in Uppsala, the cause of death was tuberculosis, and was buried in the Old Church of Uppsala (Gamla of Uppsala kyrka). <br> camera on the moon Seoul Hughes crater is named after him. <br> Comment: Although astronomers, the most famous is the thermometer.
