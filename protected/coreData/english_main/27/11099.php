'cont'=>'(Year of the OX October 11), November 27, 2009, China&#39;s first successful geostationary meteorological satellite binary position exchange. <br> <br> the Chinese Fengyun E Star <br> the Chinese Fengyun E Star the space drift has been successfully succeed Fengyun C Star. National Satellite Meteorological Center, said on November 27, 2009 This is a geostationary meteorological satellite in the history of the first successful exchange of binary star position, business succeed. <br> geostationary meteorological satellite on-orbit operations has reached three. Fengyun C Star and stable operation of the past five years, more than its three-year design life. October 22, Fengyun E Star officially began to drift. After a thirty-day drift the Fengyun E Star success drift from east longitude 123.5 degrees to 103.8 degrees near, and together with D Star Double Star Networking observation. C Star starts at 9:00 on November 15th, drift, expected two months after its original position to reach the E Star, the sentinel after successful use of the remaining fuel to carry out those observations and special tests. <br> understand, the the Fengyun E star the drift and braking process, there is no business of the star of the Fengyun C have any effect. According to the original plan, the binary star common rail business interruption time of the two days, the National Satellite Meteorological Center adopted a series of measures to solve the problem of binary star business seamless smooth transition without interruption during a times of cloud images observation, to achieve a geostationary meteorological satellite first binary star position in the history of the exchange, the complete success of the business to succeed. <br> after a one-month trial run, the Fengyun E Star will be December 23 officially put into operation. <br> Comments: This is China&#39;s aerospace industry is another major technology breakthrough <br> the'
