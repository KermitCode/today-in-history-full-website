'cont'=>'August 27, 1939 July 13 (JiMao years), the world&#39;s first jet plane to heaven. <br> 1939 8 27, the world&#39;s first jet plane flew up into the sky, this aircraft is manufactured in Germany. <br> jet different from other types of aircraft, which rely equipped with a jet engine to push the body forward. The jet engine is the use of a reaction force generated by the engine itself, the high-speed jet gas stream to advance the aircraft. This principle in ancient China had exploited. Song invention with gunpowder rocket, that is, the use of this principle. Rockets on a cardboard tube filled with gunpowder. Combustion produces a strong air flow from the tail ejected using the reaction force of the jet stream, the rocket will be able to move forward quickly. But people really fully understand this principle, or something of the early 20th century. \"Jet tools to study space,\" a book published in 1903 by the Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky, expounded the theory of rocket flight, and discussed the possibility of the rocket for interplanetary transport, put forward the idea of &#8203;&#8203;a liquid fuel rocket and schematics, and complete the world&#39;s first calculation of a jet engine. , Provides a theoretical basis for the manufacture of jet. The birth of the jet, which is a major event in the history of human transport. Per hour can fly over 1000 km to over 3000 km, high-energy flew to an altitude of 23 meters of the farthest time continuous flight of over 10 thousand kilometers. A major leap in human traffic speed. <br>'
