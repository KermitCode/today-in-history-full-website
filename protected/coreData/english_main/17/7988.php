'cont'=>'August 17, 1601 (20 July 1901), French mathematician Fermat was born. death of <br> Pierre de Fermat \"target =\" _blank \"> Fermat, French mathematician, was born in August 1601 near the south of France Toulouse Beaumont de ・ Luo Manie his father Dominique Fermat When the king of amateur mathematician - Fermat to open a large leather shops, has quite a lucrative industry, (history www.TodayOnHistory.com ) had grown up in a wealthy and comfortable environment makes Fermat&#39;s father <br> Fermat popular people respect due to the rich and business tactics, and won the title of local affairs adviser, but Fermat and not because his family was wealthy and how much superiority. the Fermat&#39;s mother 名叫克拉莱 de Rogge, wearing a robe nobility. Dominica rich Rogge nobility build Fermat pole of wealth worth. <br> Fermat childhood taught by his uncle Pierre been a good elementary education, training his wide range of interests and hobbies, has also had an important impact on his character until the age of 14 Fermat before entering of Beaumont de Luo Manie public school, and successively after graduation to study law at the University of Orleans and the University of Toulouse. <br> 17th-century France, the man most luxurious career as a lawyer, therefore, man to study law to become fashionable, but also people Jing Xian, France for those products and the lack of qualifications of prospective lawyers \"to become a lawyer as soon as possible to create good conditions for 1523, the Franco period watts I. organizations set up a specialized organs vend sell official post, and sold to the public official. Such the official the vend sell the social phenomenon has been generated, they should be the needs of the times and out of control, and dying today. <br> vend sell official, rich cater to enable them to make an official post so as to improve the social status, on the other hand, the government&#39;s financial position was improved to the 17th century, court officials and military officers outside his official trading up until today, duties of court clerks, notaries, convey people still did not completely get rid of the trading nature of buying specialty of France, which will benefit so many middle class, is no exception Fermat Fermat yet graduated from college, and they in Bo Monte De Luo Manie bought a \"lawyer\" and \"Senator\" post. (L $ djτ.ЙЁT) wait until the Fermat graduation returned home after, he easily when on Toulouse Members of Parliament, at a time 1631. <br> ability to Fermat into the community until his death did not lose office, and be raised year by year, but according to the records, Fermat and what achievements officialdom payable is also very common , let alone leadership. Fermat did not, however, interrupt promotion, he was promoted to the survey Senator Fermat any of the seven local councils, the official has the right to administrative authorities to investigate and questioned . <br> 1642, there is an authority called 勃里斯亚斯, he is the Supreme Court adviser. 勃里斯亚斯 recommended Fermat into the main court of the highest criminal court, and France Daliyuan, (TodayinHistory.cn) which makes after Fermat better chance of promotion in 1646, Fermat was promoted the parliamentary chief spokesman, later also served as President of the Catholic League and other staff. the bureaucratic career Fermat nothing outstanding achievements laudable, (TodayinHistory.cn) Fermat never used his powers to people blackmail, never taking bribes, and his honest, open and integrity to win the people&#39;s trust and praise. marriage <br> Fermat Fermat ranks among the robe nobility, Fermat married his uncle and cousin Lu Lois de Rogge. Fermat originally the mother of aristocratic descent and a sense of pride, now simply in its own name on the plus the the aristocratic surname sign \"de\". <br> Fermat gave birth to three women and two men, in addition to the eldest daughter, Kela Lai married, four children Fermat was decent two daughters when the pastor, the second when Gonzalez&#39;s vicar Feima especially the eldest son of Clay of Maintenon ・ Samo Er, he not only inherited the the Fermat public, in 1665 when the lawyer the (the l $ jτ.c) but also finishing the mathematics of Fermat. (Lssdjt. com) if not fee Ma Changzai actively publishing Fermat&#39;s mathematical theory, is hard to say such a major impact on Fermat math (? v history today?? com) because most of the papers are in Fermat&#39;s death responsible for by his eldest son. said this sense, Samo Er also be regarded as the cause of Fermat heir <br> Fermat, the real cause is an academic, especially in math. [l $ jτ.c] Fermat proficient in French, Italian, Spanish, Latin and Greek, but also has studied the language erudition to Fermat&#39;s mathematical research provides language tools and convenient, so he has the ability to learn and understanding of Arab and Italian algebra and ancient Greek mathematics. precisely these may Fermat attainments in mathematics laid a good foundation in mathematics, Fermat not only in the realm of mathematics free ride, but also can stand This can not be absolutely attributed to his mathematical talent, how much his erudition relationship bird&#39;s eye view of mathematics in mathematics earth outside. <br> Fermat naturally introverted, Humility and quiet, poor market themselves, poor display of self Therefore his lifetime rarely published his treatise, even a complete writings published he published a number of articles, and also always incognito by his eldest son after the death of the mathematical theory set or Fermat its notes, annotations and correspondence finishing a book and published. now, we have long recognized that the timing of the importance of science, even if the l7 century, this problem is also outstanding. Fermat (l $ djτ.ōr)] not timely published mathematical research, too less than the spread and development, is not entirely a loss of personal reputation, but affects the pace of progress of that era mathematical <br> fee Ma Yisheng healthy, just nearly died of the plague in 1652. 1665 New Year&#39;s Day However, Fermat began to feel a change in the body, therefore interdicted in January l0 third day, the death of Fermat Fermat (l $ djτ.ōr) is buried in the cemetery of Custer Gonzalez, later Gaizang the Toulouse family cemetery. <br> fee Ma Yisheng never received specialized mathematics education, mathematical research, but also amateur hobby. however, can not be found in France in the 17th century which mathematicians can match: he is analytic geometry, one of the inventors; (1 $ djτ.cōm) after Newton, Leibniz, the main founder of the theory of probability, and independence Order of the 17th century the number theory of heaven and earth. addition, the contribution to the birth of calculus. Fermat physics has an important contribution to the generation of math before Fermat called the greatest mathematicians of the 17th century French. (on TodayOnHistory.com) <br> 17 century, it indicates a quite spectacular mathematical prospects. fact, this century is also the history of mathematics a glorious era. geometry has become this era&#39;s most dramatic cited jade pearl, due to the geometry of the new method - algebraic methods in geometry on the application of science, a direct result of the birth of analytic geometry; projective geometry as a new way to open up new areas; problems caused by ancient quadrature minimal segmentation method introduced geometry, geometry produces a new research direction, and ultimately promote the invention of calculus, geometry re-emergence with the generation of hard thinking, creative mathematicians are inseparable, Fermat is one of them.
