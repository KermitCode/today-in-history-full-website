In In German mathematician in <br> 1742, Goldbach found that each large even number can be written as two primes and. His many even-numbered test shows that this is true, but this is the need to give proof. Before proven, can only be called a conjecture. Goldbach can not prove it, he wrote to ask the Swiss great mathematician Euler, his help to prove. Euler not completed until death. Two hundred years, how many mathematicians tried to prove to this conjecture, without success. Mathematical community has a saying: The Queen of the natural sciences is mathematics, mathematics crown number theory, Goldbach conjecture is the jewel in the crown. (Today in History TodayOnHistory.com) <br> in China, a young scientist to become a leader in the removal of \"Pearl\" in this competition, (Lssdjt.com) his name called ChenJingRun for . (History cn) <br> ChenJingRun in high school I heard the song Deba ocher conjecture story, it is deeply attracted by it, from indulging in the ocean of mathematics to overcome the Goldbach conjecture as their own struggle goals. Start from the beginning of the sixties, in a complex environment, in primitive conditions, people misunderstanding, his dedication to struggling in the removal of the \"Pearl\" Xianfeng climb. After ten years of unremitting efforts in this area, ChenJingRun reached full fruition, a world away from sinking, \"Pearl\" people. Papers <br> ChenJingRun immediately caused a sensation in the world, his conclusion is called \"Chen Theorem, the mathematical community,\" Chen Theorem hailed this area \"glorious vertex. \" (L $ dj¦Ó.¨­r¨À), a British mathematician to Chenjingrun letter said, (L $ dj¦Ó.§«§§T) \"you move mountains! <br> Writer Xu Chi reportage by \"People&#39;s Daily\", reproduced, immediately caused a sensation in the country. The official newspaper of the CPC Central Committee with such a large space and processing high standard of editorial notes, to publicize an ordinary intellectuals, is rare in people&#39;s memories. (History www.TodayOnHistory.com) <br> soon, the National Science Conference held in Beijing, Chen Jingrun as one of the young delegates on the podium. As the representatives of the Chinese intellectuals <br> ChenJingRun, (Lssdjt.com) generation of Chinese youth to learn from; ChenJingRun indomitable spirit, the courage to climb the heights of science and inspire more and more sons and daughters of the Chinese nation in their respective positions and achieve excellent results, and the glory for the country. <br>'
