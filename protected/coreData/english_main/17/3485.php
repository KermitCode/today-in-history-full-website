'cont'=>'April 17, 1790, the fourth day of March (Gengxu years), electrical founder of Franklin&#39;s death. the <br> people&#39;s daily use of the electric light, the telephone, telegraph, tram until the invention and the use of cutting-edge technology, and electricity are inseparable. However, about 250 years ago, the people for electricity ignorant. Then Westerners lightning called \"fire of God\". <br> prominent American inventor Benjamin Franklin from 1746 began to study the phenomenon of electricity through repeated experiments and summary of a book he published in 1751, the famous electrical basic theory electrical experiments and observation \" immediate sensation throughout Europe. Since then, (lssdjt.cn) Franklin became the founder of the electricity. (Lssdjt.com) <br> Franklin was born on January 17, 1706 in the city of Boston. His 8-year-old apprentice school, 12-year-old printing when printing from the 17-year-old workers. Franklin edge work hard and study diligently. The wide range of interest, a strong sense of curiosity, study hard and do not reach the goal dogged spirit, as well as for scientific thought of the dedication, as he later became an influential scientists laid the foundation. (有身d芋y身里h貝 $ 而身ry.c身m) <br> Franklin is one of the world&#39;s first electrical test. He is an electrical history of a correct interpretation of the charge properties. He has an important hypothesis put forward in the history of electricity: electricity is a usual conditions exist to a certain percentage in all material elements. He also found that the power can be transferred from one object to another object, in either an insulator, the total power is not changed. This conclusion is that the so-called Modern electrical charge conservation law. Franklin also the first time with the mathematical sign of concepts to illustrate both the nature of the charge, the source of electricity, and in the substance in the presence of, and illustrates some of the electrical characteristics of the medium. In July, <br> 1752 Franklin risked their lives once the World&#39;s draw the sferics the experimental vibration. Cause he listened to the speech of the a European electrical scholars and, being inspired. He thought, mine is not electric? Then immediately try to put mine in the the electricity received Leiden bottle. In a thunderstorm the day, he made a party Sipa a kite, kite tied with a thin metal wire and a ribbon on the other end of the knot in a key circle. When the kite days to go, Lightning passed through metal zheng line to the key, this key allows charging the Leyden jar. The experiment was a success, it proved Franklin&#39;s theory is correct. So people say: \"Franklin God and Lightning home. (On www.TodayOnHistory.com) \"<br> Franklin is not only a great scientist, is also a good politician, he participated in the drafting of the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States, made a significant contribution to the final victory of the War of Independence.
