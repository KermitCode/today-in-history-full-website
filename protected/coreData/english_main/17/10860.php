The new advent supercomputer, the new members of the computer family. Supercomputer computation speed and some features it has, but only the volume and price of minicomputers were approximately 1% and 1/10 of the giant computer. (History. Cn) <br> such a small supercomputer, the international community in recent years as the high-speed VLSI rapid development of new models appear. Our small supercomputer, the most important feature is to break the shackles of traditional architecture design ideas, mathematical expressions as an instruction to be processed directly, floating-point operation speed of up to 10 million times per second, the system wordlength 32. Can be applied to the field of petroleum, mining surveying, aerospace, scientific research, mathematics, and technology projects.
