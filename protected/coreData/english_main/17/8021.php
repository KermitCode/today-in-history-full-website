'cont'=>'July seventh) (JiMao years, August 17, 1999, a strong earthquake in Turkey killed 18,000 people. Izmit City, <br> <br> a main road side put up tents in the city a temporary shelter <br> 1999 August 17, 2011, in northwestern Turkey Izmit strong earthquake occurred in the country, killing at least $ 20 billion in direct economic losses. According to statistics released by the Turkish Prime Ministry Crisis Management Center the afternoon of August 24 showed that, in Turkey Richter 7.4 strong earthquake has now caused 17,997 people were killed and 42,442 people were injured. November 12 (on www.TodayOnHistory.com) northwest of Turkey once again a strong earthquake of 7.2 Richter, twice resulting in a total of 18,000 people were killed, 45,000 injured and more than 60 million people homeless. <br> of anonymity, according to a Turkish earthquake expert said the poor construction quality in this strong earthquake caused many buildings to collapse, resulting in heavy casualties, one of the main reasons. He said that from the beginning of the 1980s, Turkey&#39;s economy developed rapidly, many construction contractors in order to make more difference to buy poor quality of construction materials, and the blind pursuit of fast, Turkey, a large number of residential buildings is built . The city is located in the earthquake center, the vast majority of casualties caused by the earthquake occurred in more construction quality problems emerging suburban areas, in most parts of the Old City has not been too much damage, Istanbul, for example, the vast majority of intact buildings, shops, restaurants, business as usual, is located in the center of tourist attractions in the earthquake almost no damage to the world-famous Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque nearby, still see many foreign tourists. City of casualties in this earthquake is mainly due to some of the buildings collapsed because of poor construction quality. He believes that, on this issue, the Turkish authorities concerned should be on the quality of construction materials not strictly a result of a lot of poor quality buildings collapsed responsibility. <br> some experts believe the major earthquake occurred in Izmir, Turkey Kermit seven major earthquakes occurred along the North Anatolian fault in Turkey since 1939, the most recent. Turkey is located in the earthquake belt, before a big earthquake caused by the changes in the earth&#39;s crust, it will create the conditions \"for the next earthquake.\" Earthquakes occurred one after another like dominoes. 1939 Erzincan, Turkey time eight large earthquake, lots of up to 362 kilometers of the North Anatolian fault rupture. Thereafter, from 1942 to 1967, along this fault occurred five major earthquakes every part of the stratigraphy of the fault west destruction. The earthquake happened to the last (1967) terminated fault cracks caused by the earthquake. <br> they say, three active tectonic plates squeeze each other, is the root cause of this earthquake. Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean region is one of the world&#39;s most earthquake-prone zones. African plate south of Turkey, east of the Arabian plate northward movement of the two plates, with the Eurasian plate being moved south to confront. These plates is an annual rate of 1.3 to 2 centimeters move and squeeze each other, so that the plate boundary region has increased tremendously, is apt to cause earthquakes. North Anatolian fault, they say, is located just two plates squeeze each other&#39;s region. The crust increasing pressure finally led to the fault rupture suddenly, causing the earthquake. <br>'
