His youth had a deep interest in the Star. In the winter of 1782, under 20-year-old Goode Lick continuous observation of a variable star located in the constellation Perseus Algol (Perseus ¦Â Star), a measurement of the light period for 2 days 20 hours 49 minutes 8 seconds, and Algol light change mechanism, Algol light up a dark two stellar binary system, two stars each other surround operation, the overall brightness dimmed when two star mutual cover. 1888 Germany the astronomers Woge ear use spectroscopy confirmed Goode Lick this idea. This binary is now called eclipsing binaries or eclipsing variable.
