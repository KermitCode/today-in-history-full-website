'cont'=>'(Jiawu June 15), July 17, 1894, the birth of the Belgian astronomer and cosmologist Lemaitre. the <br> <br> Lemaitre Lemaitre.Georges (1894.7.17-1966.6.20), Belgium priest, astronomer and cosmologist. <br> during World War I, Lemaitre served as artillery officer in the Belgian army as a civil engineer. Enter the seminary after the war and in 1923 accepted the clergy as priests. Solar Physics Laboratory at Cambridge University in the 1923-1924 years of learning, after learning, to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he learned about the American astronomer EP Hubble&#39;s discovery and the expansion of the universe H. Shapley. The (lsjt.net) <br> in 1927, he was appointed professor of astrophysics at the University of Louvain, Lemaitre proposed Lemaitre cosmological model with this theory, the galaxies receding Einstein general relativity within the framework of explanation. Although the expansion of the universe model has made an early was raised, Gamow modified Lemaitre theory in cosmology has a dominant position. <br> Lemaitre Lemaitre metric coordinate transformation according to the Schwarzschild metric (Schwarzschild vacuum solution), which is the free fall in a gravitational pull metric. This metric is the basis of Lemaitre&#39;s model of the universe. Subsequently Robertson and Walker developed Lemaitre metric higher dimensions (three-dimensional) symmetry Robertson - Walker metric, metric basis as Gamow proposed the Big Bang model of the universe. <br> Lemaitre also studied cosmic rays and the three-body problem, the three-body problem is described using mathematical methods three mutually attracted to the movement of objects in space. <br> Lemaitre major works include \"On the evolution of the universe.\" (1933) and the original atomic hypothesis \"(1946). <br> <br> Comments: his modern Big Bang Theory ~ <br>'
