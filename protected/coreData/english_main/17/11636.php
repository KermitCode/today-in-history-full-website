'cont'=>'December 17, 1903, October 29 (mao), the successful test flight of the Wright Brothers first aircraft. . <br> 1903 human into the sky <br> 1903 12 17 successful test flight of the Wright brothers made the first aircraft \"flight No. 1 North Carolina, in the United States . <br> they succeeded in driving their own design and manufacture of heavy-than-air aircraft flight. In this regard, it is skeptical. Early highly regarded American scientist Simon Newcomb views on that flight is impossible to rely on mobile force. Seven years ago, the famous German aviation pioneer Otto - Lilienthal driving their own vehicle crashed killed. However, Wright and his brother said, the day flying over Kitty Hawk, North Carolina Beach 4 times, the longest one lasted about a minute, the flight distance of 850 feet. The presence of a further five people have witnessed their flight. Wright brothers <br> said, they hinder heavier than air aircraft flight in the Dayton bicycle repair factory to solve problems. They say, one of their most important inventions movable wingtip to control the aircraft, which the others never solve the problem. They also produce 25 horsepower light engine, this engine than ever any kind of light, but provide more power than before. The two brothers followed in the wind tunnel tests on a series of scale models of their own design and manufacture. They said, this work took more than seven years, at a cost of more than 1000 U.S. dollars. They said, however, the only patented, to post a detailed description of their aircraft. the <br> Austria Buddhist Wright and Weber Wright brothers originally operated bike, very good at mechanical manufacturing technology, many of the one of the flying enthusiasts. From 1896 they began to study the flight, and determined to produce an engine-driven aircraft. Unlike other flight design enthusiasts, they attach great importance to the theory, and read the aerodynamics of the literature. To read Lita Er writings, they also tenacious learned German. <br> After several years of trial and error, the Wright brothers finally produced the first aircraft \"flight No. 1. <br> 1903 12 17 morning 30 minutes, the Overhauser driving the aircraft in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina beach a successful powered flight, the flight distance of 36 meters, to stay in the air for 12 seconds; followed by brother Webber made a first flight, flight 3200 m results within 59 seconds. The first aircraft was born. improve <br> Wright brothers continue to aircraft, in 1904 and 1905, respectively, to create \"The Aviator\" and \"The Aviator,\" Webber driving, flying, October 5, 1905 the No. 3 sustained flight of 38 minutes, a range of up to 39 km. That is to say, \"The Aviator,\" actually has a practical performance. <br> Wright brothers was convinced that an aircraft of the era has arrived. After a few years, they side to improve the performance of the aircraft, aerobatic side in the world do, to show people the dream of human flight has become a reality. <br> 1903 human beings into the sky <br> O-Wright <br> W-Wright <br>,'
