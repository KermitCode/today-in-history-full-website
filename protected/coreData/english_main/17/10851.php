'cont'=>'November 17, 1956 (October 15) Bingshen, Deng Xiaoping said, the combination of Marxism-Leninism with China&#39;s actual situation. <br> 1956 11 17, when Deng Xiaoping met with the delegation of the International Youth they who should decide \"What is the meaning of the Chinese Communist? international classical principles of communism, which are suitable for the Chinese ? \"answer. He said: the implications of the Chinese Communist Party members or task, with language in general, there are only two words: serving the people wholeheartedly, all in the interests of the people as the highest criterion of every party member. The Communists standard is not what can be achieved. A Communist, the first, he is human, he is advanced elements in ordinary people. But there are even more backward than the average Communists. <br> Deng Xiaoping pointed out that what applies to the Chinese principle about who should decide the international classical communism. 11 years ago, the Seventh National People&#39;s Congress of the Communist Party of China has identified this principle, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, in order to guide our revolution, to guide the construction of our country. This principle is to sum up our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong past revolution failed and successful experience, and in the seventh, eighth twice Party Congress affirmed. Of course, this is just a matter of principle, the application of the principle also encountered many specific issues. A country&#39;s problems are many, and whether the revolutionary period or the period of construction, and how the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the specific circumstances of each period, which is a need to continue to solve the problem. This issue needs to the Party Congress to discuss the decision, to be discussed and decided by the Central Committee of the Congress in session. Decided also need to party members to be good at practical work to solve. First to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of backbone understand this principle, this principle will be to implement. <br> Deng Xiaoping stressed the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete realities combined phrase itself is a universal truth. It contains two aspects, one is called the universal truth, on the other hand called combine national reality. We have always put aside any side will not work. Characteristics to go hard to move things foreign to leave the country, this universal truth can not be achieved. Universal truth with specific reality on this issue, the party the past eaten many losses, and later against the subjectivism of this article has been to seize. Against subjectivism two aspects, namely against dogmatism and against empiricism. Know the words of the Marxist-Leninist dogmatism, is only starting to use, not from the specific circumstances, it makes a revolution in our country suffered failures and setbacks. Empiricism, that is, only to see some concrete practice, only to see the experience in one country, one moment, did not see the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Both are opposed. <br> Deng Xiaoping said in conclusion, based on our experience, the universal truth combined with the specific conditions of the two is not easy. Communist Party of China, also often make mistakes. But our attention and research reasons for the mistakes, correct them in time. Chairman Mao said, people should always wash your face, the house should be cleaned regularly, so party should always correct the error. I often make mistakes. Everyone is like. Chairman Mao has often said, he also often make mistakes. But we all know that his error is less than we do. Anyone can make mistakes, not definitely do not make mistakes. <br>'
