He was born in an ordinary worker&#39;s family. Mother, Wu Fengxian the Jinhua County Food company workers. Xu the Father long-term work in the field station, Xu Li, from small to large is basically growing up under the care of the mother&#39;s. Mother Wu Fengxian wages are not high on someone else processing sweater to earn money for his son to school, and let the child live a life of clothing, all-inclusive, as one reading \". Junior high school increased in Xu admitted to the school&#39;s focus on class, but a class last second half of the semester rankings. Through these efforts, the high half of the semester, Xu Li jumped to tenth place. Wu Fengxian overjoyed To son each subsequent midterm and final exams are ranked in the class before 10. However, the tragedy also this when the seeds were planted. Wu Fengxian attend parent meetings that by the end of November 1999, Xu force this semester midterm exam score came in the class 18th. After returning home, Wu Fengxian was very angry, and he beat the son of a meal. Xuli Xi Huan play football, Wu Fengxian said: \"In the future you go play football, and I put your legs interrupted. \"Under the weight of Xu was the mother too strict, and mother raised the target can not be achieved, deeply wronged and depression. 17 at noon <br> 2000, Xu force home from school eating a meal, want to watch TV for a while.

They did not understand: why such good students will dry out such atrocities? <br> local experts believe that parents hopeful, eager, the children the psychological endurance fragile and the lack of a legal concept, led to this tragedy. The Jinhua Municipal Public Security Bureau and the City Board of Education, analysts said Xu Li, who can see a contradiction: on the one hand it seems \"trained\" to kill the mother moved the corpse to cover his tracks, and also write a note to deceive his father said mother to Hangzhou \"doctor\", and actually as usual took the exam; but on the other hand, he is very fragile, just because the mother of his academic pressure, inhumane to kill mother. This shows that he&#39;s not healthy mind and a sense of law. <br> Jinhua City Board of Education believes that young people now are basically the only child, grew up under a lot of pressure, parents often expect too much of their children. The children exam is not ideal, there is a kind of feeling unworthy of the parents, the long run will inevitably lead to a psychological twist; society murder, romance books flooding, many young people go through the bad culture of monasteries, but also naive in adding a little \"premature . \" Therefore, it is very important to strengthen young people&#39;s ideological and moral education and personality cultivation.
